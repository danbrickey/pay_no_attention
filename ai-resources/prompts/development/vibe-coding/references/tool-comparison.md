- Lovable/Bolt: Minimal transferable skills
- Replit: Some coding fundamentals
- Cursor: Strong development skills developed

**Production Readiness:**
- Lovable/Bolt: 60-70% solution (needs work)
- Replit: Similar 60-70%
- Cursor: Can reach 90%+ with good practices

## Conclusion

**For beginners:** Start with Lovable or Replit

**For prototypes:** Lovable or Bolt

**For serious development:** Cursor

**For collaboration:** Replit

**For UI focus:** v0.dev + Cursor

**For existing codebases:** GitHub Copilot + Cursor

Remember: The best tool is the one that helps you ship. Start simple, learn as you go, and upgrade when you hit real limitations, not imagined ones.
