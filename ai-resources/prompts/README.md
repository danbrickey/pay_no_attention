## üöÄ Usage Guidelines

### Using Prompts in Claude Code

Reference prompts using the @-mention syntax:
```
@ai-resources/prompts/architecture/architecture_documentation_architect.md review my architecture documentation for gaps
```

### Creating New Prompts

1. Use [@meta/meta-prompt-engineer.md](meta/meta-prompt-engineer.md) to create high-quality prompts with systematic evaluation
2. Place general-purpose prompts in the appropriate category folder
3. Place project-specific prompts with their use case documentation
4. Update this README catalog when adding new prompts

### Prompt Maintenance

- **Versioning**: Update version numbers in frontmatter when making significant changes
- **Documentation**: Keep this README updated with new prompts
- **Archival**: When use cases complete, archive project-specific prompts with the use case folder
- **Centralization**: Keep general-purpose prompts here; avoid duplication across the repository
