## üß† Meta / Prompt Engineering

**Location**: [meta/](meta/)

Tools for creating and improving prompts themselves:

> üí° **New to meta prompts?** Start with `@meta-librarian` - it does everything.
> Already have a prompt and just need to organize it? Use `@librarian` for simplicity.
> Want to experiment with just prompt creation? Use `@meta` for focused workflow.

### Primary Tool (Recommended)
- **[@meta-librarian](meta/meta-librarian-architect.md)** ‚≠ê - **UNIFIED SYSTEM**: Combines prompt engineering (systematic evaluation), agentic workflow assessment (when to use subagents), and library management (organization & discovery). **Most users want this.**

### Standalone Components (Focused Tools)
- **[@meta](meta/meta-prompt-engineer.md)** - Prompt engineering only: Creates high-quality prompts using systematic evaluation methodology with 3 candidates, rubric scoring, and evidence-based selection.
- **[@librarian](meta/librarian-prompt-management.md)** - Library management only: Organizes, categorizes, discovers, and maintains the prompt library with metadata enhancement.

### Supporting Resources
- **[prompting-pattern-library/](meta/prompting-pattern-library/)** - Comprehensive library of prompting patterns, techniques, and best practices (25+ patterns, failure modes, model quirks).
- **[agentic-development/](meta/agentic-development/)** - Expert guidance on building autonomous AI agents and agentic workflows ("Just Talk To It" methodology).
- **[data_vault_refactor_prompt_generator.md](meta/data_vault_refactor_prompt_generator.md)** - Generator for creating Data Vault refactoring prompts for specific tables/entities.

## üöÄ Usage Guidelines

### Using Prompts in Claude Code

Reference prompts using the @-mention syntax with mnemonics:
```
@architect help me design a data architecture
@tutor create a learning plan for Python
@giftfinder help me find a gift for my friend
```

Or reference the full path:
```
@ai-resources/prompts/documentation/arcdoc-documentation-architect.md review my docs
```

### Creating New Prompts

1. Use [@meta](meta/meta-prompt-engineer.md) to create high-quality prompts with systematic evaluation
2. Place prompts in the appropriate category folder
3. Update this README catalog when adding new prompts
4. Use consistent frontmatter with title, author, version, tags

### Prompt Maintenance

- **Versioning**: Update version numbers in frontmatter when making significant changes
- **Documentation**: Keep this README updated with new prompts
- **Organization**: Keep prompts organized by category for easy discovery
