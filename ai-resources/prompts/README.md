### Ready-to-Use Architecture Experts
- **[@architect](architecture/architect-data-vault.md)** - Data architecture expert for Data Vault 2.0, dimensional modeling, and Snowflake platform design.
- **[@cloud](architecture/cloud-architect.md)** - Cloud architecture expert for AWS, Azure, and GCP. Covers cloud-native patterns, Well-Architected Framework, multi-cloud strategies, and cost optimization.
- **[@api](architecture/api-architect.md)** - API architecture expert for REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Specializes in microservices communication, API gateways, security, and developer experience.
- **[@security](architecture/security-architect.md)** - Security architecture expert for zero-trust, threat modeling, compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2), and defense-in-depth strategies.

## üß† Meta / Prompt Engineering

**Location**: [meta/](meta/)

Tools for creating and improving prompts themselves:

> üí° **New to meta prompts?** Start with `@meta-librarian` - it does everything.
> Already have a prompt and just need to organize it? Use `@librarian` for simplicity.
> Want to experiment with just prompt creation? Use `@meta` for focused workflow.

### Navigation & Orchestration
- **[@nav](meta/nav-resource-navigator.md)** üß≠ - **START HERE**: Intelligent routing assistant that knows the entire AI resources ecosystem. Directs you to the right prompts, docs, or workflows - and recommends creating new resources when gaps exist. **Use this when you're not sure which prompt to use.**

### Primary Tool (Recommended)
- **[@meta-librarian](meta/meta-librarian-architect.md)** ‚≠ê - **UNIFIED SYSTEM**: Combines prompt engineering (systematic evaluation), agentic workflow assessment (when to use subagents), and library management (organization & discovery). **Most users want this.**

### Standalone Components (Focused Tools)
- **[@meta](meta/meta-prompt-engineer.md)** - Prompt engineering only: Creates high-quality prompts using systematic evaluation methodology with 3 candidates, rubric scoring, and evidence-based selection.
- **[@librarian](meta/librarian-prompt-management.md)** - Library management only: Organizes, categorizes, discovers, and maintains the prompt library with metadata enhancement.

### Supporting Resources
- **[prompting-pattern-library/](meta/prompting-pattern-library/)** - Comprehensive library of prompting patterns, techniques, and best practices (25+ patterns, failure modes, model quirks).
- **[agentic-development/](meta/agentic-development/)** - Expert guidance on building autonomous AI agents and agentic workflows ("Just Talk To It" methodology).
- **[data_vault_refactor_prompt_generator.md](meta/data_vault_refactor_prompt_generator.md)** - Generator for creating Data Vault refactoring prompts for specific tables/entities.

@architect help me design a data architecture
@tutor create a learning plan for Python
@giftfinder help me find a gift for my friend
```

Or reference the full path:
```
@ai-resources/prompts/documentation/arcdoc-documentation-architect.md review my docs
```

### Creating New Prompts

1. Use [@meta](meta/meta-prompt-engineer.md) to create high-quality prompts with systematic evaluation
