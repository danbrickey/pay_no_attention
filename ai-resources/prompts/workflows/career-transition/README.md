## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"I can't decide on a target role"**:
- Run Step 1 with 3-5 options
- Complete Step 2 for your top 2-3 choices
- Compare roadmaps and viability
- Pick the shortest path or most exciting option

**"I'm overwhelmed by the process"**:
- Take one step at a time (don't try to do all 4 in one day)
- Break steps into smaller chunks
- Get accountability partner or join career transition group
- Celebrate progress, not just outcomes

**"I'm not qualified for any of these roles"**:
- Check [Vocational Career Paths](../../career/vocational_career_paths/) for entry points
- Consider stepping-stone roles (help desk → engineer, SDR → sales)
- Look at "Nearly Qualified" tier - 3-6 months can close gaps
- Use [@tutor](../../specialized/tutor-learning-assistant.md) for skill development plan

**"I've been searching for months with no results"**:
- Review application-to-interview ratio (should be 10-20%)
- If low: Improve resume, expand network, apply to more realistic roles
- If getting interviews but no offers: Focus on interview skills
- Consider if your tier assessment was accurate (may need more skill development)
