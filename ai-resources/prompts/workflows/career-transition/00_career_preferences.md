# Step 0: Career Preferences & Values Discovery

**Workflow**: Career Transition (Step 0 of 4) - **OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**
**Goal**: Understand your work preferences, values, and motivations to inform career path selection
**Time**: 20-30 minutes

## Overview

This optional but highly recommended step helps you understand what work environments, conditions, and types of work energize you versus what drains you. Unlike skills and experience (which we'll cover in Step 1), this focuses on **WHO YOU ARE** and **WHAT YOU VALUE** in work.

**Why this matters**: Two people with identical skills can have completely different career satisfaction based on work environment, company culture, and role characteristics. Understanding your preferences helps ensure you don't just pick a career you can do, but one where you'll thrive.

## When to Use This Step

**Definitely use if**:
- You've had jobs where you were skilled but unhappy
- You're unsure what type of work environment suits you
- You want to avoid repeating past career mistakes
- You're considering multiple career paths and need help choosing
- You're early in your career and want to be strategic

**You might skip if**:
- You have very clear career preferences and know what you want
- You're in urgent job search mode and need to move quickly
- You've recently completed similar self-assessment work

## Prerequisites

**What you need**:
- Some work experience (even internships, part-time, or volunteer work)
- Willingness to reflect honestly on past work experiences
- 20-30 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Open mind about exploring preferences you might not have articulated

**What you don't need**:
- Clarity about your target career (we'll help you figure that out)
- Extensive work history (even limited experience provides insights)
- Previous career assessments (this is comprehensive)

## Step 0.1: Career Preferences Interview

**Action**: Use the [Career Preferences & Values Interviewer](../../career/career-preferences-interviewer.md)

**Prompt to use**:
```
@career-preferences

I'm exploring career transitions and want to understand my work preferences, values, and what makes me thrive in work environments.
```

**What this interview covers**:

### Work Environment Preferences
- Team dynamics and size preferences
- Communication styles
- Remote/hybrid/in-person preferences
- Company culture fit

### Management & Autonomy
- Preferred management styles
- Autonomy vs. guidance preferences
- Decision-making approaches

### Work Content & Style
- Task variety vs. deep focus
- Problem-solving preferences
- Learning and growth styles
- Impact and recognition needs

### Values & Motivations
- Work-life integration priorities
- Compensation and security preferences
- Purpose and meaning requirements
- What energizes vs. drains you

**Output**: Comprehensive preference profile saved as `docs/career/career_preferences_profile.json`

**Time**: 20-30 minutes

---

## Step 0.2: Preference Profile Validation

**Action**: Review and validate your preference profile

**Questions to consider**:
1. **Does this feel accurate?** Do the preferences captured align with your self-understanding?
2. **Are there patterns you hadn't noticed?** What insights surprised you?
3. **What are your non-negotiables?** Which preferences are absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have?
4. **How might these change?** Are there preferences that might evolve with your career or life stage?

**Validation prompts**:
- Think of your most satisfying work experience - do the identified preferences align?
- Think of your most frustrating work experience - do the stressors match what was identified?
- Consider your current life circumstances - are the work-life preferences realistic?

**Time**: 5 minutes

---

## How This Connects to Step 1

Your preference profile will be used in Step 1 (Career Analysis) to:

1. **Filter career paths** that align with your preferences before detailed analysis
2. **Prioritize opportunities** that match both your capabilities AND preferences  
3. **Identify culture fit considerations** for specific companies and roles
4. **Highlight potential satisfaction risks** in career paths that might fit your skills but not your preferences

**Example**: If your preferences indicate you thrive in small teams with high autonomy, the Career Analyzer will:
- Prioritize roles and companies known for those characteristics
- Flag large corporate environments as potential culture mismatches
- Suggest startup or consulting roles over large enterprise positions
- Help you ask better questions during interviews about team structure and autonomy

---

## Checkpoint: Ready for Step 1?

Before proceeding to Career Analysis, ensure you have:

**Required**:
- ✅ Completed preferences interview OR decided to skip (if you're very confident in your preferences)
- ✅ Preference profile saved (if completed) or clear mental model of your priorities

**Optional but recommended**:
- ✅ Identified 2-3 most important preference themes (e.g., "autonomy + small teams + mission-driven work")
- ✅ Listed your absolute dealbreakers (conditions you won't accept)
- ✅ Noted any preference questions to explore further in career research

---

## If You Skip This Step

If you decide to skip the preferences interview, at minimum consider these key questions before Step 1:

1. **Work environment**: Do you prefer small teams or large teams? Remote or in-person?
2. **Autonomy**: Do you prefer clear direction or figuring things out yourself?
3. **Work-life balance**: How important is predictable hours vs. flexibility for high growth opportunities?
4. **Risk tolerance**: Do you prefer stable, established companies or higher-risk, higher-reward environments?
5. **Mission alignment**: How important is it that you believe in what your company does?

Having answers to these will help you evaluate career paths more effectively in Step 1.

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I'm not sure about my preferences?**
A: That's exactly why this step exists! The interview is designed to help you discover preferences you might not have fully examined. Start the interview and see what emerges.

**Q: Can I change my preferences later?**
A: Absolutely. Preferences evolve with experience and life circumstances. You can redo this assessment anytime, and we recommend updating it annually or after major life changes.

**Q: What if my preferences conflict with practical needs (like salary)?**
A: The interview captures both idealistic preferences and practical constraints. Step 1 will help you find the best balance between what you want and what you need.

**Q: How is this different from personality tests?**
A: This focuses specifically on work preferences rather than general personality. It's more actionable for career decisions and considers how your preferences interact with specific work environments.

**Remember**: There are no right or wrong preferences - only authentic ones. Understanding what makes you thrive at work is just as important as understanding what you're capable of doing.
