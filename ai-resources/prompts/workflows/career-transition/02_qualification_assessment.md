# Step 2: Qualification Assessment & Roadmap

**Workflow**: Career Transition (Step 2 of 4)
**Goal**: Complete detailed qualification assessment and create personalized development roadmap
**Time**: 60-90 minutes

## Overview

Now that you've selected your target career path, this step provides a deep, interactive assessment of your qualifications for that specific role. You'll complete a structured interview, receive a verdict on your readiness, and get a concrete roadmap for the next 30-90 days.

## Prerequisites (from Step 1)

## Step 2.2: Complete the Qualification Interview

**Action**: Engage with your chosen career path prompt

**How it works**:
1. The prompt introduces itself as an expert career advisor for that specific role
2. It asks if you're ready to begin
3. It conducts a structured interview with **8 targeted questions**
4. You answer ONE question at a time (it will guide you)

**The 8 questions typically cover**:
1. **Background**: Education, professional history
2. **Core Skill #1**: Most critical technical/functional skill for the role
3. **Core Skill #2**: Second most important skill
4. **Domain Experience**: Relevant project/work experience
5. **Portfolio/Evidence**: Tangible proof of capabilities
6. **Current Role**: Where you are professionally now
7. **Supporting Skills**: Secondary but important capabilities
8. **Goals & Context**: Location, timeline, preferences

**Tips for the interview**:
- ✅ **Be honest**: Accurate answers lead to better roadmaps
- ✅ **Be specific**: Provide concrete examples and details
- ✅ **Be complete**: Don't skip questions or give vague answers
- ✅ **Ask for clarification**: If you don't understand a question, ask
- ✅ **Take your time**: This is the most important step

**Example interaction**:
```
[Prompt]: Ready to begin the qualification assessment? (yes/no)

[You]: yes

[Prompt]: Question 1 - Background:
What is your educational and professional background?
Include: degrees, certifications, bootcamps, self-study, years of experience.

[You]: I have a Bachelor's in Business Administration (2018) and
5 years experience as a Business Analyst in healthcare. I've taken
online courses in Python and SQL but no formal coding bootcamp.

[Prompt continues with Question 2...]
```

**Time**: 30-45 minutes (for all 8 questions)

---

## Step 2.3: Receive Qualification Verdict

**What you'll get**: After completing the interview, the prompt provides:

### 1. QUALIFICATION VERDICT

Your readiness is assessed using a 4-tier system:

**Tier 1: Qualified Now (75%+ match)**
- You meet most requirements
- Could apply immediately
- Minor gaps, quick to close

**Tier 2: Nearly Qualified (50-74% match)**
- Solid foundation, some gaps
- 3-6 months of focused effort
- Clear path to qualification

**Tier 3: Significant Gaps (25-49% match)**
- Fundamental skills needed
- 6-12+ months of development
- Major learning required but viable

**Tier 4: Not Currently Viable (<25% match)**
- Very misaligned experience
- Would require 1-2+ years
- Consider intermediate stepping stone

**Example verdicts**:
```
QUALIFIED NOW (Tier 1 - 80% match)
You have strong JavaScript/React experience and a solid portfolio.
Main gap: lack of backend experience (Node.js/databases). With
1-2 backend projects, you'd be ready to apply for Full Stack roles.

NEARLY QUALIFIED (Tier 2 - 60% match)
Your PM skills from business analysis translate well. Gaps:
technical depth with developers, product strategy frameworks,
and metrics-driven decision making. 3-6 months of focused work
would get you interview-ready.
```

### 2. PERSONALIZED ROADMAP

**30-Day Sprint** (Quick wins):
- Immediate actions to close critical gaps
- Fast-learning resources
- Portfolio/evidence building

**3-6 Month Plan** (Core development):
- Skill building priorities
- Projects to complete
- Certifications or training

**6-12 Month Plan** (Advanced preparation):
- Advanced skills and specializations
- Network building
- Industry positioning

### 3. TOP 5 RESOURCES

Specific to YOUR gaps:
- Courses, books, tutorials tailored to what you need
- Not generic - based on your specific situation
- Prioritized by impact

### 4. INTERVIEW PREP

Role-specific interview guidance:
- Common interview questions for this role
- How to frame your experience
- Red flags to avoid
- Strengths to emphasize

### 5. SALARY EXPECTATIONS

Location-adjusted ranges:
- Entry level expectations
- Mid-level targets
- Senior compensation
- Based on your location and experience

**Time**: 15-20 minutes (to review and process)

---

## Step 2.4: Document Your Roadmap

**Action**: Capture the key elements for reference

**What to save**:
```
TARGET ROLE: [Role name]

QUALIFICATION TIER: [Tier 1/2/3/4]

30-DAY PRIORITIES:
1. [Action item]
2. [Action item]
3. [Action item]

3-6 MONTH GOALS:
1. [Skill/project]
2. [Skill/project]
3. [Skill/project]

TOP 3 CRITICAL GAPS TO ADDRESS:
1. [Gap and how to close it]
2. [Gap and how to close it]
3. [Gap and how to close it]

KEY RESOURCES:
- [Resource 1 - why it matters]
- [Resource 2 - why it matters]
- [Resource 3 - why it matters]

NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- [ ] [Specific action from 30-day plan]
- [ ] [Specific action from 30-day plan]
- [ ] [Specific action from 30-day plan]
```

**Time**: 10-15 minutes

---

## Step 2.5: Start 30-Day Sprint (Optional but Recommended)

**Decision point**: You can either:

**Option A**: Start working on your 30-day goals NOW
- Build momentum immediately
- Validate your interest in the role
- Start closing gaps before job search
- **Best if**: You're Tier 2-3 and need skill development

**Option B**: Proceed to Step 3 (Resume) while working on goals in parallel
- Create resume materials now
- Work on skill development concurrently
- **Best if**: You're Tier 1 (Qualified Now) and ready to apply

**Option C**: Defer and continue workflow
- Complete all workflow steps first
- Return to skill development after
- **Best if**: You want the full picture before committing time

**Recommendation**:
- **Tier 1 (Qualified Now)**: → Proceed to Step 3
- **Tier 2 (Nearly Qualified)**: → Start 30-day sprint, then Step 3 in parallel
- **Tier 3-4 (Significant Gaps)**: → Focus on 30-day sprint for 2-4 weeks, revisit workflow

## Troubleshooting

**"I got Tier 3-4 (Significant Gaps) - should I continue?"**:
- Yes! Knowing your gaps is valuable
- Focus on the 30-day sprint to build momentum
- Revisit Steps 3-4 after 2-3 months of development
- Consider if there's an intermediate stepping-stone role (vocational paths)

**"The roadmap seems overwhelming"**:
- Start with ONLY the 30-day sprint
- You don't have to do everything at once
- Pick the #1 highest-impact action and start there
- Progress compounds over time

**"I disagree with my qualification tier"**:
- The assessment is based on typical market expectations
- Your actual results may vary based on networking, location, timing
- Consider: are you being realistic or optimistic?
- Get a second opinion from someone in the industry

**"I want to assess multiple roles"**:
- That's fine! Run Step 2 for each role you're considering
- Compare the roadmaps and choose the most viable
- This might reveal one path is much shorter than others

**"The interview questions were hard to answer"**:
- It's OK to say "I don't have experience with X yet"
- The prompts use this honesty to give better guidance
- Vague answers lead to generic advice

## Tips for Success

💡 **Take the interview seriously**: This is the most valuable step - don't rush it

💡 **Be brutally honest**: Inflating your skills leads to bad roadmaps

💡 **Save everything**: Copy the full output - you'll reference it constantly

💡 **Seek validation**: Share your roadmap with someone in your target field

💡 **Track progress**: Check off completed items, celebrate wins
