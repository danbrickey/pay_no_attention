## Step 4.2: Define Your Job Search Strategy

**Action**: Create your personalized job search plan

### A. Set Your Search Parameters

**Target roles** (be specific):
- Primary title: [e.g., "Product Manager", "Full Stack Engineer"]
- Alternative titles: [e.g., "Associate PM", "Software Engineer", "Frontend Developer"]
- Avoid: [Titles that don't fit, e.g., "Senior PM" if you're entry-level]

**Company criteria**:
- **Size**: Startup (<50), Mid-size (50-500), Enterprise (500+)?
- **Stage**: Early startup, growth stage, established?
- **Industry**: Healthcare, fintech, SaaS, e-commerce, etc.?
- **Location**: On-site, remote, hybrid? Geographic preferences?
- **Values**: Mission-driven, work-life balance, innovation-focused?

**Deal-breakers**:
- Minimum salary requirement
- Required benefits
- Location constraints
- Work arrangement (must be remote?)

**Example search strategy**:
```
TARGET ROLE: Full Stack Engineer (entry-level to mid-level)
ALTERNATIVE TITLES: Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, Software Engineer

COMPANY CRITERIA:
- Size: Prefer mid-size (50-500) or growth startups
- Industry: SaaS, fintech, or healthtech
- Location: Remote or Seattle-area
- Values: Collaborative culture, learning opportunities

DEAL-BREAKERS:
- Minimum $80K salary
- Must offer health benefits
- Fully remote or Seattle-area only
- No on-call/24-7 support roles
```

**Time**: 15-20 minutes

### B. Set Your Activity Goals

**Weekly activity targets** (adjust based on your timeline):
- **Applications submitted**: 5-10 per week
- **Networking conversations**: 2-3 per week
- **Company research sessions**: 3-5 companies per week
- **Interview prep hours**: 2-4 hours per week

**Monthly milestones**:
- Month 1: 20-40 applications, 8-12 networking calls, 2-4 interviews
- Month 2: 20-40 more applications, 8-12 networking calls, 4-8 interviews
- Month 3: Offers and negotiations

**Adjust for your qualification tier**:
- **Tier 1 (Qualified Now)**: Aggressive search (10+ apps/week)
- **Tier 2 (Nearly Qualified)**: Moderate search (5-7 apps/week) + skill building
- **Tier 3-4 (Significant Gaps)**: Light search (2-3 apps/week) + focus on development

**Time**: 10 minutes

---

## Step 4.3: Build Your Target Company List

**Action**: Identify 30-50 target companies

**Where to find companies**:
- LinkedIn Jobs (filter by your criteria)
- Indeed, Glassdoor, Built In (location-based)
- AngelList / Wellfound (startups)
- Company aggregators (Y Combinator companies, Inc 5000)
- Industry-specific job boards
- Your network's companies

**For each company, research**:
- What they do (product/service)
- Size and stage
- Recent news (funding, growth, launches)
- Culture (Glassdoor reviews, LinkedIn)
- Tech stack (if relevant)
- Who you know there (LinkedIn connections)

**Create a tracking spreadsheet**:
```
| Company | Role | Priority | Status | Contact | Notes |
|---------|------|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| Acme Corp | PM | High | Researching | Jane (2nd connection) | Just raised Series B |
| Beta Inc | Software Eng | Medium | Applied | None | Good culture reviews |
```

**Prioritize companies**:
- **High**: Perfect fit, you have a connection, actively hiring
- **Medium**: Good fit, no connection yet
- **Low**: Reach/aspirational, or backup options

**Time**: 30-40 minutes

---

## Step 4.4: Execute Multi-Channel Job Search

**Strategy**: Don't rely on applications alone. Use multiple channels:

### Channel 1: Direct Applications (30% of effort)

**How to apply strategically**:

1. **Analyze job posting** using [Job Search Strategist](../../career/job-search-strategist/)
   - Identify green flags (career growth, learning, mentorship)
   - Spot red flags (unrealistic requirements, vague descriptions)
   - Extract keywords for resume tailoring

2. **Tailor your resume** for each application
   - Mirror language from job description
   - Emphasize relevant skills/projects
   - Adjust professional summary

3. **Write custom cover letter**
   - Use template from Step 3
   - Address career transition directly
   - Show company-specific research
   - Connect your experience to their needs

4. **Submit through right channel**
   - Company website > LinkedIn Easy Apply
   - Include all requested materials
   - Follow up after 1-2 weeks if possible

**Reference**: [Job Posting Flags Guide](../../career/job-search-strategist/references/job-posting-flags.md)

### Channel 2: Networking (50% of effort) 🌟 MOST IMPORTANT

**Why networking matters for career changers**:
- 70%+ of jobs filled through networking
- Bypasses ATS systems and keyword screening
- Provides insider information and referrals
- Builds relationships in new industry

**How to network effectively**:

**A. Leverage existing network** (warm outreach):
- LinkedIn connections in target industry
- Alumni from your school in target roles
- Former colleagues who've made similar transitions
- Friends of friends (2nd degree connections)

**B. Cold outreach** (informational interviews):
```
Template message:
"Hi [Name],

I'm transitioning from [current role] to [target role] and came across your
profile. I'm impressed by [specific thing about their career/company].

Would you be open to a 15-20 minute informational interview? I'd love to learn
about your experience in [target role/company] and get your advice on making
this transition successfully.

I understand you're busy, so I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Thanks for considering!
[Your Name]"
```

**C. Attend industry events**:
- Meetups (meetup.com)
- Conferences (even virtual)
- Workshops and webinars
- Professional associations

**D. Engage on LinkedIn**:
- Comment thoughtfully on posts in your industry
- Share relevant articles with insights
- Join LinkedIn groups for target role
- Follow companies and engage with their content

**E. Seek referrals**:
- After networking calls, ask: "Do you know anyone else I should talk to?"
- When applying, check LinkedIn for connections at the company
- Request referrals (not just "Can you refer me?" but "I'd love to be considered...")

**Networking activity tracker**:
```
| Contact | Company | Date | Outcome | Follow-up |
|---------|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| Jane Doe | Acme | 10/20 | Informational interview | Send thank you, ask for intro to PM team |
| John Smith | Beta | 10/22 | LinkedIn connection | Schedule coffee chat |
```

### Channel 3: Recruiter Outreach (20% of effort)

**Work with recruiters**:
- **Internal recruiters**: Reach out directly to companies
- **External recruiters**: Agency recruiters who specialize in your field
- **Niche recruiters**: Focus on specific industries (tech, creative, healthcare)

**How to approach**:
- Update LinkedIn to "Open to Work" (visible to recruiters only)
- Respond to recruiter messages (even if not perfect fit)
- Be clear about your career transition and timeline
- Ask about companies and roles, not just "find me a job"

**Time allocation across channels**:
- 30% Direct applications (2-3 hours/week)
- 50% Networking (3-5 hours/week)
- 20% Recruiter outreach (1-2 hours/week)

**Time**: Ongoing (6-10 hours/week total)

---

## Step 4.5: Track and Manage Your Search

**Action**: Set up application tracking system

**What to track**:
- Company and role applied to
- Application date
- Resume/cover letter version used
- Status (Applied, Screening, Interview, Offer, Rejected)
- Contacts at company
- Interview dates and feedback
- Follow-up dates
- Notes

**Tools**:
- Spreadsheet (simple, customizable)
- Notion or Airtable (more advanced)
- Huntr or JobScan (dedicated job search trackers)

**Reference**: [Templates and Examples](../../career/job-search-strategist/references/templates-and-examples.md)

**Weekly review routine**:
- Sunday: Plan week's applications and outreach
- Wednesday: Mid-week check-in and adjustments
- Friday: Review progress, send follow-ups, plan next week

**Time**: 15 minutes setup + 30 min/week maintenance

---

## Step 4.6: Interview Preparation

**Action**: Prepare for interviews using your career path assessment

**What you have from Step 2**:
- ✅ Interview prep guidance for your specific role
- ✅ Common questions for your target role
- ✅ How to frame your experience
- ✅ Strengths to emphasize
- ✅ Red flags to avoid

**Interview preparation steps**:

### A. Study Common Questions
- "Tell me about yourself" (career narrative)
- "Why are you making this career change?"
- "What are your strengths/weaknesses?"
- "Tell me about a time when..." (behavioral questions)
- Role-specific technical or case questions

### B. Prepare Your Stories
**Use STAR format** (Situation, Task, Action, Result):
- 3-5 professional stories that demonstrate key skills
- Quantified results whenever possible
- Relevant to target role, not just previous role

**Example STAR story for career changer**:
```
Question: "Tell me about a time you had to learn a new skill quickly"

Situation: "While working as a Business Analyst, our team needed to automate
repetitive reporting tasks, but we had no developer resources."

Task: "I volunteered to learn Python to build the automation solution."

Action: "I completed a Python course in 3 weeks, built a prototype in 2 weeks,
and iterated based on team feedback."

Result: "The final solution saved the team 15 hours per week and became the
standard reporting tool. This experience showed me I love building solutions
with code, which is why I'm transitioning to software engineering."
```

### C. Address the Career Change
**Prepare your "why" story**:
- What sparked your interest in the new field?
- What have you done to prepare? (courses, projects, networking)
- Why this company/role specifically?
- How does your previous experience add value?

**Frame it positively**:
- ❌ "I hate my current job and want something different"
- ✅ "I've always been interested in [field], and through [projects/learning],
      I've discovered this is my passion. My [previous experience] gives me a
      unique perspective on [value you bring]."

### D. Prepare Questions to Ask
- About the role: "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"
- About the team: "How does the team collaborate? What's the structure?"
- About growth: "What are typical career paths from this role?"
- About company: "What are the biggest challenges facing the team right now?"
- About culture: "How would you describe the company culture?"

### E. Practice
- Mock interviews with friends or mentors
- Record yourself answering questions
- Join interview prep groups or platforms (Pramp, Interviewing.io)
- Practice role-specific skills (coding, case studies, portfolio review)

**Time**: 2-4 hours/week during active interviewing

---

## Step 4.7: Handle Rejections and Iterate

**Reality check**: Career changers often have lower success rates initially
- Typical response rate: 10-20% (1-2 interviews per 10 applications)
- Career changers: Often 5-10% (need 2x the applications)
- This is NORMAL - don't get discouraged

**When you get rejections**:
- ✅ Ask for feedback (politely): "I'd appreciate any feedback to help me improve for future opportunities"
- ✅ Review your materials: Is your resume tailored? Cover letter compelling?
- ✅ Assess fit: Was this a realistic target given your Tier from Step 2?
- ✅ Keep going: Rejections are data points, not personal judgments

**When to iterate**:
- After 20-30 applications with no interviews → Review resume/materials
- After 5+ phone screens with no further interviews → Work on interview skills
- After 3+ final rounds with no offers → Refine your pitch and close

**Get help**:
- Mock interviews with mentors
- Resume reviews from people in target industry
- Career coaches or counselors
- Join job search accountability groups
