# Step 3: Resume & Materials Development

**Workflow**: Career Transition (Step 3 of 4)
**Goal**: Create tailored, ATS-optimized resume and supporting materials for your target role
**Time**: 90-120 minutes

## Overview

With your target role selected and qualification roadmap in hand, it's time to create professional materials that position you as a strong candidate. This step transforms your experience into a compelling narrative for your target role.

## Prerequisites (from Steps 1-2)

You should have:
- ✅ Selected target career path
- ✅ Completed qualification assessment
- ✅ Know your qualification tier and gaps
- ✅ Understand how to frame your experience for the target role

## Step 3.1: Choose Your Resume Strategy

**Decision**: Select the approach that matches your situation

### Strategy A: Career Transition Resume (Most Common)
**Best for**: Switching industries or roles, need to reframe experience
**Focus**: Highlighting transferable skills, de-emphasizing irrelevant experience
**Resume type**: Combination (skills + experience)

### Strategy B: Career Progression Resume
**Best for**: Moving up within same field (e.g., Engineer → Senior Engineer)
**Focus**: Demonstrating growth, increasing responsibility
**Resume type**: Chronological

### Strategy C: Career Restart Resume
**Best for**: Bootcamp grads, career gap, entry-level, vocational paths
**Focus**: Projects, skills, education over work history
**Resume type**: Functional or Entry-Level format

### Strategy D: Specialized Resume
**Best for**: Niche roles requiring specific expertise (AI, security, healthcare)
**Focus**: Deep technical skills, certifications, specialized experience
**Resume type**: Technical resume with skills emphasis

**Which strategy fits you?**
- Transitioning from Business Analyst → Product Manager? → **Strategy A**
- Moving from Junior → Mid-Level Developer? → **Strategy B**
- Bootcamp grad or vocational path? → **Strategy C**
- Targeting AI Prompt Engineer or Security Architect? → **Strategy D**

**Time**: 5 minutes

## Step 3.2: Use the Resume Builder

**Action**: Navigate to [Resume Builder](../../career/resume-builder/)

**What to review first**:
1. **[README.md](../../career/resume-builder/README.md)** - Overview and approach
2. **[resume-builder.md](../../career/resume-builder/resume-builder.md)** - Main resume creation prompt
3. **[References](../../career/resume-builder/references/)** - Best practices, ATS optimization, industry guidance

**Prepare your materials**:
- Previous resume/CV (if you have one)
- List of jobs/roles with dates
- Key accomplishments and projects
- Skills and tools
- Education and certifications
- Portfolio links (if applicable)

**Time**: 10-15 minutes (preparation)

---

## Step 3.3: Run Resume Creation Session

**Action**: Engage with the Resume Builder prompt

**Process**:

### Phase 1: Content Gathering (20-30 min)
The prompt will interview you to extract:
- Work history with quantified achievements
- Technical and soft skills
- Education and certifications
- Projects and portfolio items
- Awards, publications, volunteer work

**Tips**:
- **Quantify everything**: Use numbers, percentages, dollar amounts
- **Use action verbs**: "Led", "Designed", "Implemented", not "Responsible for"
- **Focus on impact**: Not just what you did, but the outcome
- **Be specific**: "Increased sales 30%" not "Improved sales"

**Example responses**:
```
Bad: "Worked on web applications"
Good: "Developed 5 React applications serving 50K+ monthly users,
      reducing page load time by 40%"

Bad: "Managed a team"
Good: "Led team of 6 engineers to deliver $2M project 2 weeks
      ahead of schedule with 98% stakeholder satisfaction"
```

### Phase 2: Resume Selection (5 min)
Based on your situation, the Resume Builder will recommend:
- **Chronological**: [Template](../../career/resume-builder/assets/template-chronological.md)
- **Combination**: [Template](../../career/resume-builder/assets/template-combination.md)
- **Functional**: [Template](../../career/resume-builder/assets/template-functional.md)
- **Entry-Level**: [Template](../../career/resume-builder/assets/template-entry-level.md)

### Phase 3: Resume Draft (30-45 min)
The prompt will create your resume draft including:
- Professional summary tailored to target role
- Optimized skills section
- Experience section highlighting transferable skills
- Education and certifications
- Optional sections (projects, portfolio, volunteer)

### Phase 4: ATS Optimization (10-15 min)
The prompt will:
- Add relevant keywords from target job descriptions
- Format for ATS compatibility
- Ensure proper section headers
- Check for common ATS mistakes

Reference: [ATS Optimization Guide](../../career/resume-builder/references/ats-optimization.md)

**Time**: 60-90 minutes (full session)

## Step 3.4: Tailor for Your Target Role

**Critical step**: Generic resumes don't work for career transitions

**Action**: Customize your resume for your specific target

**Use insights from Step 2**:
- Highlight skills that close your identified gaps
- Reframe experience using language from the target industry
- Emphasize projects/achievements relevant to target role
- De-emphasize or remove irrelevant experience

**Example tailoring**:

**Target: Product Manager (from Business Analyst)**
```
Before:
"Gathered requirements and created documentation for software projects"

After (PM-focused):
"Defined product requirements and roadmap for $500K software initiative,
collaborating with engineering and design to deliver customer-driven features
that increased user engagement 25%"
```

**Target: Full Stack Engineer (from Bootcamp)**
```
Before:
"Learned JavaScript, React, and Node.js at coding bootcamp"

After (Engineer-focused):
"Built 4 full-stack applications using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL,
including an e-commerce platform serving 1K+ users with 99.9% uptime
and sub-200ms API response times"
```

**Reference**: [Industry Career Guidance](../../career/resume-builder/references/industry-career-guidance.md)

**Time**: 20-30 minutes

## Step 3.5: Create Supporting Materials

**Action**: Develop additional materials to support your application

### A. Cover Letter Template (15-20 min)

**Use the Resume Builder** to create a template cover letter that:
- Explains your career transition motivation
- Connects your transferable skills to the target role
- Shows enthusiasm and culture fit
- Addresses potential concerns about the transition

**Template structure**:
```
Paragraph 1: Why this role/company excites you + your background in one sentence
Paragraph 2: Transferable skills and relevant experience
Paragraph 3: Specific example/achievement demonstrating fit
Paragraph 4: Address the transition (why you're making this move)
Paragraph 5: Next steps + enthusiasm
```

### B. LinkedIn Profile Update (10-15 min)

**Action**: Update your LinkedIn to match your resume

**Key changes**:
- **Headline**: Reflect target role, not current one
  - Current: "Business Analyst at HealthCorp"
  - Target: "Aspiring Product Manager | Business Analysis & Product Strategy"
- **About**: Tell your transition story
- **Experience**: Mirror resume accomplishments
- **Skills**: Add target role skills, get endorsements
- **Featured**: Add portfolio projects

### C. Portfolio/Work Samples (If Applicable)

**For tech roles**:
- GitHub profile with pinned projects
- Personal website/portfolio
- Blog posts or technical writing

**For creative roles**:
- Behance/Dribbble portfolio
- Case studies
- Work samples

**For business roles**:
- Slide decks (sanitized)
- Case studies or analysis samples
- Writing samples

**Time**: Varies (0-60 min depending on role)

**Self-review checklist**:
- [ ] Resume is 1-2 pages (1 for <10 years experience, 2 for 10+)

- [ ] Quantified achievements (numbers, percentages, impact)
- [ ] Keywords from target job descriptions included

**Time**: 15-20 minutes

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't have enough experience for a full resume"**:

**"I have gaps in my work history"**:
- Address gaps honestly in cover letter
- Use functional resume to de-emphasize chronology
- Fill gaps with freelance, projects, learning
- Focus on what you DID do during gaps

**"My previous experience seems irrelevant"**:
- That's the point of career transition resumes!
- Find transferable skills (communication, problem-solving, leadership)
- Reframe using target industry language
- Focus on outcomes, not job titles

**"I'm not getting past ATS systems"**:
- Review [ATS Optimization Guide](../../career/resume-builder/references/ats-optimization.md)
- Add more keywords from job descriptions
- Remove complex formatting (tables, columns, graphics)
- Use standard section headers ("Work Experience" not "My Journey")

**"How do I explain career change in cover letter?"**:
- Be honest but positive about the transition
- Focus on why you're excited about new field
- Emphasize transferable skills
- Show you've done the work (projects, learning, prep)

## Tips for Success

💡 **Quantify everything**: Numbers make achievements real and memorable

💡 **Keywords matter**: Mirror language from job descriptions (without keyword stuffing)

💡 **Tailor for each application**: Generic resumes get generic results

💡 **Format for ATS**: 60%+ of applications are screened by software first

💡 **Tell a story**: Your resume should explain your career narrative

💡 **Keep it concise**: Hiring managers spend 6-10 seconds on first resume scan

💡 **Proofread relentlessly**: One typo can eliminate you from consideration

💡 **Update regularly**: As you gain skills/projects, update immediately
