## Focus Areas for Director Audience
- begin with a half page summarized status report of strategically important items and brief status info, with some color coded indicators to help read it at a glance
- follow this with a more detailed summary, but still concise enough that, if read aloud, would take 1-2 minutes. 
- Resource allocation and team capacity issues
- Timeline impacts and milestone progress
- Technical architecture decisions affecting project scope
- Stakeholder engagement and communication needs
- Risk identification and mitigation strategies
- Budget implications and vendor relationships
- Cross-team dependencies and coordination needs

## Focus Areas for Diaper Sheet
- My action item progess
- Each action item that should typically be delegated by an architect to another role should be noted with the main skill(s) needed to perform that task. 
- My Completed tasks
- My Follow up
- I am Blocked by:
  - list things stopping progress that are outside of my teams domain
- I am Blocking:
  - list things I am working on that are likely to be blocking other teams
- Format should be simple bullet lists that can be easily pasted into a chat or email.
- Ideally, if read aloud, a 5-6 minute concise update for a technical audience with an understanding of our project (me)

## Focus Areas for Agile Team Audience
- Blockers, action item progess, technical decisions, and completed tasks
- Only technical decisions that relate to the teams skills and abilities.
- The team is composed of two Snowflake admins (Ian and Mike), a data and solution architect (me), a contractor cloud architect (Emily), our scrum master (Emmanuel), and product owner (Sam)
- Ideally, if read aloud, a 1-2 minute concise update for a technical audience
- Format should be simple bullet lists that can be easily pasted into a chat or email for communication.

## Exclusions
- Individual contributor tactical details
- Code-level technical discussions
- Routine operational updates
- Meeting logistics and scheduling

## Tone
Professional, concise, action-oriented. Emphasize business impact and strategic implications over technical implementation details.
