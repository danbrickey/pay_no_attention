# Content Quality Evaluators

Specialized evaluators for marketing, sales, and operations content. These prompts assess specific content types against measurable criteria to identify and fix AI-generated "slop"—generic content that wastes reader time.

## Quick Start

1. **Choose your evaluator** based on content type (see catalog below)
2. **Copy the evaluator prompt** into your AI tool
3. **Append the content** you want evaluated
4. **Get structured feedback** with:
   - Overall score (0-5 scale)
   - Dimension-by-dimension analysis
   - Verdict (ACCEPT/REVISE/REJECT)
   - 3-5 surgical fixes with exact locations and replacement text

## Philosophy

These evaluators combat AI's tendency to produce verbose, generic content by requiring:

- **Specificity**: Concrete examples instead of vague claims
- **Proof**: Verifiable data instead of assertions
- **Clarity**: Exact fixes instead of "make it better"
- **Measurability**: 0-5 scores instead of subjective judgment

See [Evaluation Framework](references/evaluation-framework.md) for detailed methodology.
