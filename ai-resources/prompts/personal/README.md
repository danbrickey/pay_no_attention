    2025-10/
      journal-2025-10-26.md
      journal-2025-10-27.md
    2025-11/
      journal-2025-11-01.md
  therapy-sessions/            # Therapy assistant sessions
    general/                   # From therapy-assistant.md
      2025-10/

   - Do a quick brain dump of your day (2-3 sentences is fine!)
   - Answer the clarifying questions
   - Save the journal entry to `docs/journal/YYYY-MM/journal-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Tips for Effective Use

### Journaling Best Practices
1. **Don't overthink it**: Stream of consciousness is perfect
2. **Be honest**: The AI doesn't judge, and honesty leads to better insights
3. **Review regularly**: Patterns emerge over time, not in single entries
4. **Use the therapy section**: Flag items worth exploring professionally
5. **Track action items**: Export tasks to your productivity system

### Therapy Assistant Best Practices
1. **Start with intention**: What do you want to focus on today?
2. **Reference previous sessions**: Continuity deepens therapeutic value
3. **Practice skills between sessions**: Real change happens in daily life
4. **Know when to escalate**: Trust the referral recommendations
5. **Share with professionals**: Session notes can support human therapy

### Privacy & Data Considerations
- These are **local files** in your repository
- Consider **encryption** if storing sensitive content
- Be mindful of what you **commit to git** (use `.gitignore` for private journals)
- Never share session notes without **careful review**

## Integration with Other Prompt Categories

**Career Development**:
- Use therapy prompts to process work stress before using [Career CV Interviewer](../career/career-cv-interviewer.md)
- Journal about career transitions to identify values and preferences

**Documentation & Knowledge Management**:
- Use [Meeting Notes Summarizer](../documentation/meeting_notes_summarizer.md) for work, Daily Reflection for personal
- Both create structured outputs from unstructured input

**Meta-Prompting**:
- If these prompts need customization, use [Meta-Librarian Architect](../meta/meta-librarian-architect.md) to evolve them
- Reference therapy patterns when customizing your [.ai/instructions.md](../../../.ai/instructions.md)

---

## Continuous Improvement

These prompts should evolve with your needs:

- **Too structured?** Reduce question count or skip sections
- **Missing something?** Add custom sections to journal template
- **New patterns?** Create dedicated tracking documents
- **Therapeutic approach not fitting?** Customize tone or techniques

Use the [Meta-Librarian Architect](../meta/meta-librarian-architect.md) to systematically improve these prompts based on your experience.

**Remember**: Personal growth is a journey, not a destination. These tools are here to support your path, at whatever pace feels right for you.
