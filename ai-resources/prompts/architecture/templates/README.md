## 🎯 How to Use These Templates

### Step 1: Choose Your Template
Select the template that matches your need:
- **Architecture expert advisor** → General Architecture Expert
- **Documentation system** → Technical Documentation Architect
- **Diagram/visualization tool** → Visual Architecture Specialist

### Step 2: Copy and Customize
1. Copy the template file to your target location
2. Rename it appropriately (e.g., `cloud-architect.md`, `api-documentation-manager.md`)
3. Search for all `[PLACEHOLDER]` markers
4. Replace each with your domain-specific content
5. Remove or adapt sections that don't apply
6. Add domain-specific sections as needed

### Step 3: Review Customization Guide
Each template includes a "Template Customization Guide" section at the bottom with:
- Step-by-step customization instructions
- What to replace in each section
- Recommended content for your domain
- Example instantiations

### Step 4: Test and Refine
1. Test your new prompt with representative questions
2. Refine based on response quality
3. Add domain-specific examples and patterns
4. Document any custom sections you added

### Step 5: Register Your New Prompt
1. Add proper frontmatter with metadata
2. Update the main [prompts README](../../README.md) to include your new prompt
3. Consider adding a mnemonic for quick access
4. Document relationship to source template in frontmatter

## 📐 Template Design Principles

All templates follow these design principles:

### 1. **Generalized but Specific**
- Extract common patterns, but leave room for domain specificity
- Use `[PLACEHOLDERS]` for required customization
- Provide examples to guide customization

### 2. **Self-Documenting**
- Include customization guides within templates
- Show example instantiations
- Explain design decisions and trade-offs

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Start with high-level structure
- Allow deepening of detail in specific areas
- Support multi-audience use cases

### 4. **Modular & Composable**
- Sections can be removed if not needed
- New sections can be added for specific domains
- Templates can be combined (e.g., Architecture Expert + Visual Specialist)

### 5. **Quality-Focused**
- Include quality checklists
- Define best practices and anti-patterns
- Establish clear standards

## 🔄 Relationship to Specialized Prompts

These templates are **extracted patterns** from successful specialized prompts. The relationship is:

```
Template (Generalized)  →  Specialized Instance (Domain-Specific)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

General Architecture     →  @architect (Data Vault specialist)
Expert Template          →  [Your Cloud Architecture expert]
                         →  [Your Software Architecture expert]

Technical Documentation  →  @arcdoc (EDP documentation architect)
Architect Template       →  [Your API documentation system]
                         →  [Your project documentation manager]

Visual Architecture      →  @drawio (Draw.io specialist)
Specialist Template      →  [Your Mermaid diagram generator]
                         →  [Your multi-tool visualizer]
```

**Key Point**: The specialized prompts remain valuable as **ready-to-use tools** for specific domains. The templates provide **reusable patterns** for creating new prompts in other domains.

## 🛠️ When to Use Templates vs. Specialized Prompts

### Use Existing Specialized Prompts When:
- ✅ Your need exactly matches the specialized domain
- ✅ You want immediate, ready-to-use functionality
- ✅ You don't need customization beyond what the prompt offers

**Example**: Need Data Vault architecture guidance? Use [@architect](../architect-data-vault.md) directly.

### Use Templates When:
- ✅ You need similar functionality in a different domain
- ✅ Your project has unique requirements not covered by existing prompts
- ✅ You're building organization-specific prompts
- ✅ You want to create a family of related prompts

**Example**: Need a Kubernetes architecture expert? Use [General Architecture Expert](general-architecture-expert.md) template and customize for Kubernetes.

## 📚 Template Metadata

### Frontmatter Standards for Template-Based Prompts

When creating a new prompt from a template, include this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "[Your Prompt Title]"
author: "[Your Name]"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "1.0.0"
category: "[category]"
tags: ["[relevant tags]"]
status: "active"
based_on_template: "architecture/templates/[template-name].md"
template_version: "1.0.0"
audience: ["[target audiences]"]
mnemonic: "@[shortcut]"  # Optional, for quick access
---
```

This metadata helps:
- Track template lineage
- Identify prompts created from templates
- Update prompts when templates evolve
- Discover related prompts

---

## 🔍 Template Evolution

### Version Control
Templates are versioned independently:
- **Template versions** track changes to the template itself
- **Instance versions** track changes to prompts created from templates
- When templates are updated, instances *may* want to incorporate improvements

### Proposing Template Improvements
If you create a specialized prompt and discover patterns that should be in the template:
1. Document the pattern or improvement
2. Consider if it generalizes beyond your specific domain
3. Propose adding it to the relevant template
4. Update template version and changelog

### Creating New Templates
If you identify a new common pattern across 2-3 prompts:
1. Extract the common structure
2. Create a new template in this directory
3. Add `[PLACEHOLDERS]` for customization
4. Write a customization guide
5. Update this README to document the new template
