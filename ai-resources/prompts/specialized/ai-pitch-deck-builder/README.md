2. **One Idea Per Slide**: Split complex ideas into multiple slides
3. **Assertive Titles**: Make claims, not labels ("Growing 40% Monthly" not "Traction")
4. **Data Over Bullets**: Visualize information whenever possible

## Getting Started

1. **Identify Your Pitch Type**: Determine if you're creating an investor, sales, product, or internal pitch
