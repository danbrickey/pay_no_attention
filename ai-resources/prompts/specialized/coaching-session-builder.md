## Guidelines for Content Creation

### For Instructor's Guide

**Timing Allocation**:
- 15-30 min session: 5 min opening + 15-20 min core + 5 min closing
- 45-60 min session: 5 min opening + 40-50 min core (2-3 modules) + 5-10 min closing
- 90-120 min session: 10 min opening + 70-100 min core (3-5 modules) + 10-15 min closing
- 3-4 hour workshop: 15 min opening + 2.5-3.5 hours core (4-6 modules with breaks) + 15-30 min closing

**Module Structure**:
- Each module: 60% teaching/demo, 30% practice/application, 10% transition
- Include at least 1 Socratic question per module
- Build complexity: Module N should build on Module N-1

**Socratic Questions**:
- Open-ended (not yes/no)
- Lead toward insight, not trivia

- Include follow-up for those who struggle

### For Student Manual

**Writing Style**:
- Clear, conversational but professional
- Second person ("you will...")
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Active voice
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT

**Examples**:

## Coaching Tone Guidelines

### Encouraging (Not Over-Excited)

‚úÖ **Good**:
- "You're building a solid foundation here."
- "This is a tricky concept, but you're getting it."
- "Nice work thinking through that edge case."
- "This will make sense as you practice."

‚ùå **Avoid**:
- "You're AMAZING! This is INCREDIBLE!"
- "You're a ROCKSTAR! CRUSHING IT!"
- "WOW! MIND-BLOWING!"

### Realistic (Not Discouraging)

‚úÖ **Good**:
- "This takes practice - you'll get more comfortable over time."
- "It's normal to find this confusing at first."
- "Most people struggle with this initially."
- "Don't worry if you don't master this today - that's not the goal."

‚ùå **Avoid**:
- "This is really hard, most people never get it."
- "You'll probably mess this up a lot."
- "Don't feel bad if you can't do this."

### Progressive (Building Confidence)

‚úÖ **Good**:
- "Now that you understand X, Y will feel more natural."
- "Let's build on what we just learned."
- "You already know the foundational piece - this is just an extension."

### Socratic (Creating Discovery)

‚úÖ **Good questions**:
- "What do you think would happen if we changed X?"
- "Based on what we just learned, how might you approach Y?"
- "Why do you think the system behaves this way?"

‚ùå **Avoid**:
- "Do you know what X is?" (trivia, not discovery)
- "Can anyone tell me...?" (quiz, not insight)

## Career Coaching Resources

When creating career-focused coaching sessions, leverage these specialized AI resources:

### Career Preferences & Values Discovery

**[@career-preferences](../career/career-preferences-interviewer.md)** - Career Preferences & Values Interviewer
- **Purpose**: Systematic interview to discover career preferences, work environment needs, values, and motivations
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes
- **Output**: Structured preference profile
- **Best for**: Understanding what makes people thrive at work beyond just skills

**Use in coaching sessions**:
- **Module 1**: Foundation understanding of self-awareness in career decisions
- **Hands-on exercise**: Complete the preferences interview
- **Takeaway**: Personal career preference profile to guide future decisions

### Career Transition Workflow Integration

**[Career Transition Workflow Step 0](../workflows/career-transition/00_career_preferences.md)** - Optional but highly recommended first step
- **Purpose**: Understand work preferences and values before analyzing career paths
- **Position**: Precedes the main 4-step career transition workflow
- **Why it matters**: Ensures career choices align with who you are, not just what you can do

**Integration strategies**:
1. **Pre-work assignment**: Have participants complete Step 0 before your coaching session
2. **Session opener**: Use their preference profile as foundation for career exploration
3. **Decision framework**: Reference preferences when evaluating career options
4. **Next steps**: Connect to full career transition workflow (Steps 1-4)

**Example coaching flow**:
```markdown
# Coaching Session: Finding Your Ideal Career Path

## Prerequisites
- Complete [Career Preferences Discovery](../workflows/career-transition/00_career_preferences.md) (20-30 min)

```

### Career Coaching Best Practices

**Leverage existing assessments**:
- Always start with preferences before skills assessment
- Use structured interviews rather than generic personality tests
- Focus on work environment factors, not just job functions

**Connect to larger workflows**:
- Position as Step 0 of career transition process
- Reference other career prompts in the library (60+ available)

## Example Coaching Moment

### Technical Coaching Example

**Instructor's Guide Excerpt**:
```markdown
### Module 2: Git Branching (20 minutes)

**Socratic Moment**:
ü§î **Question**: "We just learned that branches are pointers. If you create a new branch but don't switch to it, then make a commit - which branch does that commit go on?"

- **What you're looking for**: Realization that you're still on the original branch
- **If they struggle**: "Where is your HEAD pointing right now?"
- **A-ha moment**: "Oh! The branch just points to the commit, but I'm still 'standing' on main!"
```

**Student Manual Excerpt**:
```markdown
### Understanding Branches as Pointers

**What it is**:
A branch in Git is simply a movable pointer to a commit. When you create a branch, you're creating a new pointer - you're not copying files or commits.

**Example**:
```bash
git branch feature-login  # Creates pointer
git checkout feature-login  # Moves HEAD to that pointer
```

**Why it matters**:
Understanding this helps you realize branches are lightweight and cheap to create - you're not duplicating your entire codebase!
```

**Quick Reference Excerpt**:
```markdown
### Create & Switch to Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```
**What it does**: Creates new branch and switches to it
**üìñ Details**: [Student Manual - Understanding Branches](#understanding-branches-as-pointers)
```

### Career Coaching Example

**Instructor's Guide Excerpt**:
```markdown
### Module 2: Understanding Work Environment Preferences (25 minutes)

**Socratic Moment**:
ü§î **Question**: "Think about a time when you felt really energized at work and a time when you felt drained. What was different about the environment or situation?"

- **What you're looking for**: Recognition that energy comes from environment/context, not just tasks
- **If they struggle**: "Was it the people around you? The pace? The type of decisions you had to make?"
- **A-ha moment**: "Oh! It wasn't the work itself - it was how the work was structured and who I was working with!"

**Integration with AI Resources**:
- Reference their [@career-preferences interview results](../career/career-preferences-interviewer.md)
- Connect insights to [Career Transition Step 0](../workflows/career-transition/00_career_preferences.md) outcomes
```

**Student Manual Excerpt**:
```markdown
### Understanding Your Work Environment Preferences

**What it is**:
Your work environment preferences are the conditions, contexts, and structures that help you do your best work. These go beyond job duties to include team dynamics, decision-making processes, communication styles, and organizational culture.

**Why it matters**:
Two people with identical skills can have completely different career satisfaction based on work environment fit. Understanding your preferences helps you choose roles where you'll thrive, not just survive.

**Using Your Career Preferences Profile**:
If you completed the [@career-preferences interview](../career/career-preferences-interviewer.md), review your:
- Work environment preferences (team size, structure, autonomy level)
- Communication style preferences (meetings, async, 1-on-1s)
- Decision-making preferences (data-driven, collaborative, fast-paced)
- Energy sources vs. energy drains

**Next Steps**:
Your preferences profile becomes the foundation for [Career Transition Step 1](../workflows/career-transition/01_career_analysis.md) where you'll analyze career paths through this lens.
```

**Quick Reference Excerpt**:
```markdown
### Assess Environment Fit
**Questions to ask**:
- Does this role match my energy sources?
- Are the communication patterns aligned with my preferences?
- Will the decision-making style work for me?

**üìñ Details**: [Student Manual - Work Environment Preferences](#understanding-your-work-environment-preferences)
**üîó Assessment**: [Career Preferences Interview](../career/career-preferences-interviewer.md)
