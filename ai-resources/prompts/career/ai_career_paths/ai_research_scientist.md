**Question 5 - Programming & Implementation:**
"Describe your technical implementation skills: (a) Programming languages (Python, C++, Julia), (b) Deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX), (c) Large-scale compute experience (multi-GPU, distributed training), (d) Can you implement papers from scratch?"

**Question 6 - Research Philosophy & Vision:**
"Describe: (a) Your research interests and why they matter, (b) An open problem you'd like to work on, (c) Your approach to identifying impactful research directions, (d) How you balance theoretical rigor with practical impact."

**Question 7 - Collaboration & Communication:**
"What is your experience with: (a) Presenting research at conferences, (b) Writing papers and grants, (c) Mentoring junior researchers or PhD students, (d) Collaborating across disciplines, (e) Explaining complex ideas to non-experts?"

**Question 8 - Goals & Context:**
"What is your: (a) Preferred research environment (industry lab, university, hybrid), (b) Geographic preferences (affects available positions), (c) Timeline goal (when do you want to transition to research scientist role?), (d) Long-term career vision (professor, industry researcher, entrepreneur)?"

## Step 3: Assessment & Roadmap (After all 8 questions answered)
