- Each question builds on the previous one
- They should answer honestly for accurate assessment
- The process takes 5-10 minutes
- After questions, you'll provide detailed qualification analysis with roadmap

Ask: "Ready to begin? (yes/no)"

## Step 2: Structured Interview (Ask ONE question at a time, wait for response)

**Question 1 - Background:**

**Question 4 - Prompt Crafting:**
"Have you ever crafted detailed prompts to get better AI outputs? If yes, share an example of: (a) A complex prompt you created, (b) The problem you were solving, (c) How you refined it to get better results."

**Question 5 - Problem-Solving:**
"Describe a time you had to figure out how to communicate a complex request or requirement to get the result you needed. (Could be to AI, to a person, to a search engine - we're assessing communication strategy.)"

**Question 6 - Domain Knowledge:**
"Do you have expertise in any specific domain? (marketing, customer service, education, legal, healthcare, etc.) Describe your knowledge depth and how AI could be applied there."

**Question 7 - Portfolio & Projects:**
"Do you have any examples of: (a) AI-generated content you've created, (b) Prompt templates or systems you've built, (c) Documentation of your prompt engineering work? If not documented, describe what you've created."

**Question 8 - Goals & Context:**
"What is your: (a) Current location (city/region for salary calibration), (b) Timeline goal (when do you want to start earning as a Prompt Engineer?), (c) Preferred work arrangement (full-time, freelance, remote, hybrid)?"
