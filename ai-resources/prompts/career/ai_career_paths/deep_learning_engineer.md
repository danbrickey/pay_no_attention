**Question 7 - Production & Scale:**
"What is your experience with: (a) GPU programming and CUDA, (b) Distributed training (multi-GPU, multi-node), (c) Model optimization (quantization, pruning, distillation), (d) Deployment frameworks (ONNX, TensorRT, TorchServe), (e) MLOps and model monitoring?"

**Question 8 - Goals & Context:**
"What is your: (a) Current location (city/region for salary calibration), (b) Timeline goal (when do you want to work as DL Engineer?), (c) Target application area (computer vision, NLP, recommender systems, etc.), (d) Current role and years of DL experience?"
