# Resume Best Practices

## Core Principles

### Content Hierarchy
1. **Contact Information** - Name, phone, email, location (city/state), LinkedIn, portfolio/GitHub (if relevant)
2. **Professional Summary** (optional but recommended) - 2-4 sentences highlighting key qualifications
3. **Experience** - Reverse chronological, with measurable achievements
4. **Education** - Degree, institution, graduation date (recent grads may place before experience)
5. **Skills** - Relevant technical and professional competencies
6. **Additional Sections** (as applicable) - Certifications, publications, awards, volunteer work, projects

### Writing Principles

**Achievement-Oriented Language**
- Use action verbs: led, developed, implemented, increased, reduced, streamlined
- Quantify results wherever possible: percentages, dollar amounts, time savings, scale
- Follow the formula: Action Verb + Task + Result/Impact
- Example: "Reduced customer support response time by 35% through implementation of automated ticket routing system"

**Professional Tone**
- Use past tense for previous roles, present tense for current role
- Avoid first-person pronouns (I, me, my)
- Be concise - every word should add value
- Use industry-standard terminology while remaining accessible

**Relevance Over Completeness**
- Tailor content to the target position
- Emphasize transferable skills for career transitions
- De-emphasize or omit irrelevant experience (unless it fills gaps)
- Recent experience deserves more detail than older positions

## Format Standards

### Length Guidelines
- **Entry-level (0-5 years)**: One page strongly preferred
- **Mid-career (5-15 years)**: One to two pages
- **Senior/Executive (15+ years)**: Two pages acceptable, rarely three

### Visual Design
- **Margins**: 0.5-1 inch on all sides
- **Font**: Professional sans-serif (Calibri, Arial, Helvetica) or serif (Times New Roman, Garamond) at 10-12pt
- **Headings**: 14-16pt, bold or slightly larger font
- **Spacing**: Consistent line spacing (1.0-1.15), adequate white space between sections
- **Alignment**: Left-aligned for easy scanning (centered headers acceptable)
- **Consistency**: Uniform formatting for dates, locations, bullet points throughout

### File Format
- Submit as PDF unless specifically requested otherwise (preserves formatting)
- Use descriptive filename: FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf
- Ensure accessibility: proper heading tags, readable text (not embedded in images)

## Section-Specific Guidance

### Contact Information
**Include:**
- Full name (larger font, bold)
- Phone number with professional voicemail
- Professional email address (firstname.lastname@provider.com format)
- City and State (full address not necessary)
- LinkedIn profile URL (customized if possible)
- Portfolio/GitHub/website (for relevant fields)

**Exclude:**
- Date of birth
- Marital status
- Photo (in US; customs vary internationally)
- Social Security number
- Full street address

### Professional Summary
**When to Include:**
- Career changers explaining transferable skills
- Experienced professionals highlighting breadth
- Highly competitive fields requiring immediate impact
- When job requirements are very specific

**How to Write:**
- 2-4 sentences maximum
- Lead with years of experience and key expertise
- Mention specific skills matching job requirements
- Include 1-2 notable achievements or unique qualifications
- Example: "Marketing professional with 8+ years driving growth for SaaS companies. Expertise in digital strategy, content marketing, and data analytics. Led campaigns that increased MQLs by 150% and contributed to $5M in new revenue."

**When to Skip:**
- Entry-level positions where experience is limited
- When space is at premium and experience speaks clearly
- Internal applications where you're already known

### Work Experience

**Company and Role Information:**
- Job Title | Company Name, Location (City, State)
- Employment dates (Month Year – Month Year or Present)
- Brief company description for lesser-known organizations

**Bullet Points:**
- Start with strong action verbs
- Focus on accomplishments over responsibilities
- Quantify whenever possible - metrics demonstrate impact
- Use 3-6 bullets per position (more for recent roles, fewer for older)
- Target 1-2 lines per bullet (brief and scannable)

**STAR Method for Achievements:**
- **Situation**: Context or challenge
- **Task**: Your responsibility
- **Action**: What you did
- **Result**: Measurable outcome

**Examples of Strong Bullets:**
- ❌ Weak: "Responsible for managing social media accounts"
- ✅ Strong: "Grew Instagram following from 2K to 45K in 8 months through targeted content strategy and influencer partnerships"

- ❌ Weak: "Worked on improving customer satisfaction"
- ✅ Strong: "Increased customer satisfaction scores from 3.2 to 4.6/5.0 by redesigning onboarding process and implementing proactive support system"

### Education

**Recent Graduates (0-2 years):**
- Place education before experience
- Include GPA if 3.5+ (or above department average)
- List relevant coursework (3-5 courses)
- Include honors, awards, scholarships
- Mention thesis/capstone project if relevant

**Experienced Professionals:**
- Place after experience section
- Include degree, major, institution, graduation year
- Omit GPA (unless specifically requested or truly exceptional)
- Include honors (cum laude, Dean's List) if achieved

**Format:**
Degree, Major | Institution Name, Location
Graduation Month Year

### Skills Section

**Technical Skills:**
- Group by category (Programming Languages, Frameworks, Tools, etc.)
- List in order of proficiency/relevance
- Be honest - you may be tested on these
- Use standard industry terminology

**Professional Skills:**
- Focus on hard skills over soft skills
- Include certifications with credentials
- Mention language proficiency if relevant (and proficiency level)
- Quantify when possible: "Advanced Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, macros)"

**Avoid:**
- Listing soft skills without context ("excellent communicator")
- Obvious skills ("Microsoft Word," "email" for professional roles)
- Outdated skills unless relevant to specific role
- Skills rated with bars/stars (subjective and imprecise)

### Additional Sections

**Projects** (especially for developers, designers, career changers):
- Personal or academic projects demonstrating relevant skills
- Include project name, technologies used, brief description, link if available
- Focus on impact or what you learned

**Certifications:**
- List current, relevant professional certifications
- Include issuing organization and date obtained
- Use official credential names and acronyms
- Update or remove expired certifications

**Publications/Presentations:**
- Relevant for academic, research, thought leadership positions
- Use proper citation format (APA, MLA, Chicago)
- Include co-authors if applicable
- Link to online versions when available

**Volunteer Work:**
- Include when relevant to target role
- Demonstrates commitment, leadership, skills
- Format similar to work experience with accomplishments

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Content Errors:**
1. **Typos and grammatical errors** - Proofread multiple times, use tools, have others review
2. **Inconsistent verb tenses** - Past for previous roles, present for current
3. **Generic objective statements** - Replace with professional summary or omit
4. **Using "responsible for"** - Shift to accomplishment-based language
5. **Including irrelevant information** - Every line should strengthen your candidacy
6. **Duties without impact** - Transform responsibilities into achievements
7. **Unexplained employment gaps** - Address briefly if necessary
8. **Too much personal information** - Keep it professional

**Format Errors:**
1. **Dense text blocks** - Use white space and bullet points
2. **Inconsistent formatting** - Dates, bullets, spacing must match throughout
3. **Unprofessional email address** - Use firstname.lastname format
4. **Decorative fonts or colors** - Professional doesn't mean boring, but readability is key
5. **Headers/footers with page numbers on one-page resumes** - Unnecessary
6. **Multiple columns** - Can interfere with ATS parsing
7. **Text boxes or tables** - Often cause ATS parsing issues

**Strategic Errors:**
1. **Not tailoring to job description** - Customize for each application
2. **Leading with education when experience is stronger**
3. **Including references** - Provide when requested, not on resume
4. **Using "References available upon request"** - Assumed and wastes space
5. **Hobbies/interests** - Generally omit unless directly relevant or notable

## Tailoring Your Resume

### Job Description Analysis
1. **Identify keywords**: Both technical skills and competencies
2. **Note required vs. preferred qualifications**: Prioritize requirements
3. **Understand company culture**: Reflect values in language/examples
4. **Match level**: Ensure your experience aligns with position seniority

### Customization Strategy
- **Reorder bullet points**: Lead with most relevant achievements
- **Adjust professional summary**: Mirror key requirements
- **Emphasize relevant skills**: Move matching competencies to top
- **Add context**: Explain lesser-known companies or roles when beneficial
- **Remove irrelevancies**: Trim less relevant experience for space

### Keyword Integration
- Use exact phrases from job description when accurate
- Incorporate throughout (not just skills section)
- Maintain natural, readable language
- Focus on substance over keyword stuffing
