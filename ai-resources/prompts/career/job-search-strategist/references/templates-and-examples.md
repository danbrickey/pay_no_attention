# Templates, Examples, and Sample Assets

This reference provides concrete templates, example messages, and sample frameworks to make the job search strategy immediately actionable.

## Self-Diagnostic Tool: Where's Your Search Breaking Down?

Use this rubric to identify which phase needs attention. Rate yourself 1-5 on each dimension:

### Clarity Diagnostics
- [ ] I can explain my target role in one sentence (1 = no clarity, 5 = crystal clear)
- [ ] I know exactly what problems I solve and for whom (1 = vague, 5 = specific)
- [ ] I can list 3-5 companies that would be perfect fits (1 = no targets, 5 = researched list)
- [ ] I understand what makes me different from other candidates (1 = generic, 5 = unique value clear)

**Score < 12**: Your search lacks direction. Start with Phase 1 research and Phase 2 skills mapping.

### Proof Diagnostics
- [ ] I have quantified achievements with specific metrics (1 = none, 5 = multiple)
- [ ] My LinkedIn/portfolio demonstrates my best work (1 = outdated, 5 = impressive)
- [ ] I can tell compelling stories about my impact (1 = struggle with examples, 5 = confident)
- [ ] I have testimonials, recommendations, or social proof (1 = none, 5 = strong validation)

**Score < 12**: You need to build credibility assets. Focus on Phase 3 portfolio development.

### Distribution Diagnostics
- [ ] I'm reaching decision-makers, not just applying online (1 = applications only, 5 = multi-channel)
- [ ] I have warm connections at target companies (1 = cold only, 5 = referrals)
- [ ] My outreach messages get responses (1 = crickets, 5 = >30% response rate)
- [ ] I'm tracking my pipeline and conversion rates (1 = no tracking, 5 = detailed metrics)

**Score < 12**: Your distribution is weak. Prioritize Phase 4 creative strategy and outreach.

### Overall Health Score
- **48-60**: Strong position, focus on optimization
- **36-47**: Solid foundation, address specific gaps
- **24-35**: Significant weaknesses, systematic rebuild needed
- **12-23**: Start from scratch with clarity work

## Decision Matrix: Prioritizing Target Roles

Use this framework to evaluate opportunities:

| Company/Role | Fit (1-10) | Leverage (1-10) | Energy (1-10) | Total | Priority |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|----------|
| Example Corp PM Role | 8 | 6 | 9 | 23 | High |
| Startup Designer | 6 | 9 | 7 | 22 | Medium |
| BigCo Analyst | 9 | 4 | 5 | 18 | Low |

**Fit**: Do your skills and experience directly match their needs?
**Leverage**: Do you have connections, unique skills, or timing advantages?
**Energy**: Are you genuinely excited about this opportunity?

**Target**: 20+ total score. Prioritize roles scoring 23+.

## Job Search Operating Rhythm

### Daily (30-60 minutes)
- [ ] Review 2-3 new job postings with red/green flag analysis
- [ ] Send 2-3 personalized outreach messages (LinkedIn, email, or comments)
- [ ] Engage with 5-10 posts from target companies or hiring managers (thoughtful comments)
- [ ] Update your tracking spreadsheet with responses and next steps

### Weekly (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Deep research on 1-2 priority companies (Phase 1 full analysis)
- [ ] Apply to 3-5 strategically selected roles (not spray-and-pray)
- [ ] Schedule/conduct 2+ informational interviews or networking calls
- [ ] Create or improve one portfolio piece, blog post, or proof asset
- [ ] Review pipeline: conversion rates, what's working, what's not

### Monthly (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Comprehensive pipeline review: applications → responses → interviews → offers
- [ ] Update resume and LinkedIn based on what's resonating
- [ ] Expand network: attend 1-2 industry events or virtual meetups
- [ ] Skill development: complete one course module or certification milestone
- [ ] Strategy adjustment: what tactics are working? What should you stop doing?

### Pipeline Metrics to Track
- **Top of Funnel**: Applications sent, outreach messages, connection requests
- **Middle of Funnel**: Response rate, informational chats, recruiter screens
- **Bottom of Funnel**: Interviews, final rounds, offers
- **Conversion Rates**: Applications → screens (target: 10-20%), screens → interviews (target: 30-50%)

    ↑__________________|
```

### Strategy Prioritization Model

```
Tactic Selection = (Company Culture × 40%) 
                 + (Candidate Strengths × 40%) 
                 + (Job Level × 20%)

Example:
Creative startup + Video skills + Mid-level
= Video cover letter (High priority)

Enterprise B2B + Strong network + Senior-level  
= Referral hunting (High priority)
```

## Next Steps After Using This Reference

1. **Complete self-diagnostic** → identify your weak phase
2. **Implement operating rhythm** → daily/weekly/monthly structure
3. **Build tracking spreadsheet** → start measuring conversion rates
4. **Adapt templates** → personalize for your voice and situation
5. **Run one complete cycle** → pick one role, go through all four phases
6. **Measure and iterate** → what worked? What didn't? Adjust.

Remember: This is an operating system, not a checklist. Adapt based on what's working in your specific market and situation.
