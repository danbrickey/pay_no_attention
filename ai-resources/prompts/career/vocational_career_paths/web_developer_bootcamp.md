**8-Question Assessment for Web Developer (Bootcamp Track)**

**Q1:** "Current situation, bootcamp (completed, in progress, considering?), self-taught progress, any degree?"
**Q2:** "Coding skills: Rate (1-10) & months experience: (a) HTML/CSS, (b) JavaScript, (c) React/Vue/Angular, (d) Backend (Node, Python, Ruby)?"
**Q3:** "Portfolio: How many projects? Any deployed/live? (a) Personal projects, (b) Freelance work, (c) Contributions to open source, (d) Bootcamp projects?"
**Q4:** "Learning path: (a) Bootcamp (which one?), (b) Self-taught (FreeCodeCamp, Odin, Udemy), (c) Computer science degree, (d) Hybrid?"
**Q5:** "Job search readiness: (a) GitHub portfolio, (b) Personal website, (c) LinkedIn optimized, (d) Resume tech-focused, (e) Interview prep (algorithms, system design)?"
**Q6:** "Specialization interest: (a) Frontend, (b) Backend, (c) Full stack, (d) Mobile (React Native), (e) Specific tech (React, Node, Python/Django)?"
**Q7:** "Commitment: Hours/week for learning? Timeline to job search? Financial runway (savings, working while learning)?"
**Q8:** "Location (tech hub vs remote), setting preference (startup, agency, corporate, freelance)?"

**QUALIFIED (75%+)**: $60K-$80K - Bootcamp grad or equivalent self-taught, 3+ portfolio projects, JavaScript (7+), framework (6+), GitHub presence
**NEARLY (50-74%)**: Build more projects, improve algorithms/data structures, practice interviews (LeetCode Easy)
**GAPS (25-49%)**: Complete bootcamp or 6-12 months intensive self-study, build 3 portfolio projects
**NOT VIABLE (<25%)**: Foundation: Start with HTML/CSS/JS basics, FreeCodeCamp, commit to learning plan

**Career Progression:**
1. **Junior Developer** ($60K-$80K): Mentorship-heavy, learning on job, simple features - 0-2 years
2. **Mid-Level Developer** ($80K-$110K): Independent work, larger features, code review - 2-4 years
3. **Senior Developer** ($110K-$150K): Architecture decisions, mentoring, complex problems - 4-7 years
4. **Staff/Principal Engineer** ($150K-$220K+): Technical leadership, system design - 7-12 years
5. **Alternatives**: Engineering Manager ($140K-$200K), Solutions Architect ($130K-$180K), freelance/agency owner

**Learning Paths:**

**Bootcamp Path (3-6 months intensive)**:
- **Top bootcamps**: App Academy, Hack Reactor, Flatiron School, General Assembly
- **Cost**: $15K-$20K (some ISAs - Income Share Agreements available)
- **Pros**: Structured, fast, job placement support, networking
- **Cons**: Expensive, intense, not deep CS fundamentals

**Self-Taught Path (6-18 months part-time)**:
- **Curriculum**: FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, CS50 (Harvard), Frontend Mentor
- **Cost**: $0-$500 (mostly free, maybe Udemy courses)
- **Pros**: Flexible, cheap, deep learning if disciplined
- **Cons**: Slower, need self-discipline, no built-in networking

**Portfolio Requirements:**
- **Minimum 3 projects**: Personal site + 2 full-stack apps
- **Must have**: Live/deployed (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku), GitHub repos, README docs
- **Examples**: Todo app (CRUD), ecommerce site, social media clone, API integration
- **Showcase**: Clean code, responsive design, error handling, testing (bonus)

**Job Search Strategy:**
- **Entry-level targets**: Startups (more willing to hire bootcamp grads), agencies, small companies
- **Avoid initially**: FAANG (harder without CS degree), large enterprise (degree requirements)
- **Timeline**: 3-6 months job search typical for bootcamp grad
- **Applications**: 50-100+ applications, expect 5-10% response rate initially

**Key Skills to Develop:**
- **Technical**: Git/GitHub, responsive design, REST APIs, databases, deployment
- **Interview**: LeetCode Easy problems, behavioral questions (STAR method), portfolio walkthrough
- **Soft skills**: Communication, collaboration, learning agility

**Income Expectations:**
- **Junior (bootcamp grad)**: $60K-$80K (lower in non-tech hubs)
- **After 2 years**: $80K-$100K
- **After 4 years**: $100K-$130K
- **Senior (6-8 years)**: $120K-$160K+
- **Geographic**: SF/NY/Seattle $20K-$40K higher than average

**Red Flags (Bootcamps):**
- Job placement rate <70%
- High upfront cost with no refund/ISA option
- Outdated curriculum (jQuery, older tech stacks)
- No career support after graduation
