4. **QA Architect/Engineering Manager** ($120K-$160K+): Strategy, team leadership - 7+ years

**Why QA is Great Entry Point:**
- **Low barrier**: No coding required initially (unlike dev roles)
- **Tech exposure**: Learn how software works, see full stack
- **Transition opportunity**: Can learn to code on the job → automation (big pay jump)
- **Always needed**: Every company needs QA
- **Transferable**: Domain knowledge valuable (fintech QA → product manager)

**Skills to Develop:**
- **Manual testing**: Test case design, exploratory testing, regression
- **Tools**: Jira, TestRail, browser DevTools, Postman (API testing), SQL basics
- **Automation path**: Python/JavaScript, Selenium, Cypress, CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- **Soft skills**: Attention to detail, developer collaboration, user empathy

**Certifications:**
- **ISTQB Foundation**: Entry-level, widely recognized (~$200)
- **ISTQB Advanced**: After 2-3 years experience
- **Automation specific**: Selenium certifications, vendor-specific (Cypress, etc.)

**Key Resources:**
