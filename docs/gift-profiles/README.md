## How to Use This System

### Creating a New Profile

1. **Copy the template**: Use [profile-template.md](profile-template.md) as your starting point
2. **Choose category**: Decide which subfolder fits best (family, friends, etc.)
3. **Name the file**: Use format `FirstName-LastName.md` (e.g., `Jane-Smith.md`)
4. **Fill in details**: Add what you know now; leave blanks for later
5. **Update index**: Add entry to [profile-index.md](profile-index.md) for searchability

### Finding a Profile

**Method 1: Browse by Category**
- Navigate to the appropriate subfolder (family, friends, etc.)
- Profiles are alphabetically organized by filename

**Method 2: Search by Name/Address**
- Open [profile-index.md](profile-index.md)
- Use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F) to search by:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Nickname/description
  - Tags (hobbies, interests, etc.)

**Method 3: Use Claude Code Search**
- Use `@` to mention the giftfinder prompt
- Ask: "Find profile for [person]" or "Show me profiles for people interested in [hobby]"
- Use Grep tool to search across all profiles: Search for keywords in interests, addresses, etc.

### Updating a Profile

1. **Open the profile** using one of the search methods above
2. **Update sections** as you learn new information:
   - Add new interests or hobbies
   - Update sizes when you find out
   - Add gift ideas to the Ideas Bank
   - Record gifts you've given in Gift History
3. **Update "Last Updated" date** in the frontmatter
4. **Update the index** if name, address, or key details changed

### Recording a Gift

After giving a gift, update two sections in the recipient's profile:

1. **Gift History** table: Add the gift with date, what it was, and their reaction
2. **Ideas Bank** table: Mark the idea as "Purchased" if it came from there, or add it to history

This prevents duplicate gifts and helps you remember what worked!

## Profile Organization Tips

### Choosing the Right Category

- **family/**: Spouse, children, parents, siblings
- **extended-family/**: Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws, step-family
- **friends/**: Close friends you exchange gifts with regularly
- **neighbors/**: People in your neighborhood or community
- **coworkers/**: Work colleagues, bosses, team members
- **other/**: Service providers, acquaintances, teachers, coaches, etc.

**Note**: If someone fits multiple categories, choose where you'll most naturally look for them.

### File Naming Conventions

Use this format for easy alphabetical browsing:
- **Individual**: `FirstName-LastName.md` (e.g., `Sarah-Johnson.md`)
- **Couple**: `FirstName-and-FirstName-LastName.md` (e.g., `Tom-and-Lisa-Chen.md`)
- **Family**: `LastName-Family.md` (e.g., `Martinez-Family.md`)
- **Nickname/Known as**: Add to frontmatter tags and index, but use legal/full name for filename

### Keeping Profiles Current

**Regular Maintenance Tips**:
- After birthdays/holidays: Update gift history within a week
- During conversations: Jot down new interests or hints they drop
- Seasonal updates: Review profiles before major gift-giving seasons
- Annual cleanup: Archive profiles for people you no longer exchange gifts with

## Searchable Index

The [profile-index.md](profile-index.md) file provides quick lookup functionality. It includes:
- **Name** (with nicknames/aliases)
- **Category** (which folder)
- **Address** (for card sending or reference)
- **Key Tags** (interests, easy search terms)

**Keep the index updated** whenever you:
- Create a new profile
- Move someone to a different category
- Update their address
- Discover a significant new interest or preference

## Privacy & Security Notes

**Important**: This directory contains personal information about people you know.

- **Do NOT commit to public repositories** if this repo is or becomes public
- Consider adding `docs/gift-profiles/` to `.gitignore` if sharing this repo
- Keep size and personal details private
- Use discretion when sharing gift ideas with others
