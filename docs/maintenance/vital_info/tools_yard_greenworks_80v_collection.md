## Maintenance Procedures

### Post-Use Cleaning (All Tools)
**Frequency**: After every use
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes per tool
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah's dry climate means less rust concern but more dust accumulation
- Remove all grass clippings before they dry and harden
- Dust can clog vents and affect motor cooling

**Steps**:
1. **SAFETY**: Remove battery before any cleaning
2. Use soft brush or compressed air to remove debris
3. Wipe down housing with damp cloth (not wet)
4. Clean air intake vents thoroughly
5. Remove packed grass from mower deck underside
6. Inspect for damage or loose parts
7. Store in dry location

**Required Tools**: Soft brush, compressed air (optional), cloths
**Materials Needed**: None (water only, no solvents)

**SAFETY WARNING**: Never use water near battery connections. Never submerge any electrical components.

### Battery Care & Charging
**Frequency**: After each use + monthly during storage
**Duration**: 5 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah temperature extremes affect battery performance
- **DO NOT charge** in temperatures below 32°F or above 104°F
- Store batteries indoors in Orem winters (can drop to 19°F)
- Heat above 89°F reduces battery lifespan

**Optimal Charging**:
1. Remove battery from tool after use
2. Allow to cool for 15-30 minutes if hot
3. Charge in temperature-controlled space (50-86°F ideal)
4. Use only GreenWorks 80V chargers
5. Unplug charger when fully charged
6. Store batteries at 30-50% charge if not using within 30 days

**Storage Guidelines**:
- **Short-term** (< 30 days): Fully charged OK
- **Long-term** (winter storage): 30-50% charge
- **Temperature**: Store 32-86°F (indoor storage in Utah)
- **Check monthly**: Charge if below 30%
- **Never store** completely discharged

**Battery Lifespan**:
- Expected: 500-1,000 charge cycles
- Typical lifespan: 3-5 years with proper care
- Signs of aging: Reduced runtime, slower charging

### Blade Sharpening (Mower, Trimmer)
**Frequency**: Every 20-25 hours of use, or monthly during season
**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Difficulty**: Moderate

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah's fine dust can dull blades faster than humid climates
- Dry grass is more abrasive than wet grass

**For Mower Blade**:
1. Remove battery for safety
2. Tilt mower on side (air filter up, never on its side with filter down)
3. Wear gloves - blades are sharp
4. Remove blade bolt (turn counterclockwise, use block of wood to prevent rotation)
5. Note blade orientation for reinstallation
6. Sharpen with file or bench grinder at 30-45° angle
7. Balance blade on blade balancer or nail
8. Reinstall with cutting edges facing forward
9. Torque to manufacturer specs (typically 35-40 ft-lbs)

**For String Trimmer** (if applicable):
- Replace line when short (0.080" diameter typical for GreenWorks)
- Inspect cutting head for damage
- Clean debris from guard and cutting area

**Required Tools**: Socket wrench, blade balancer, file or grinder, work gloves
**Materials Needed**: Replacement blade (keep spare), trimmer line

**Professional Service**: Hardware stores often sharpen for $10-15

### End-of-Season Storage (November)
**Frequency**: Annual
**Best Time**: November (before winter storage)
**Duration**: 1-2 hours for all tools
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Orem winters too cold for garage storage of batteries
- Bring batteries indoors (basement, utility room)
- Clean tools thoroughly to prevent corrosion

**Steps**:
1. **Clean all tools** thoroughly (see cleaning procedure)
2. **Inspect** for damage, make note of needed repairs
3. **Sharpen** all blades/cutting edges
4. **Lubricate** moving parts with light machine oil
5. **Charge batteries** to 30-50% for storage
6. **Remove batteries** and store indoors at 50-70°F
7. **Store tools** in dry location (garage/shed OK for tools, not batteries)
8. **Label** any repairs needed for spring
9. **Set reminder** to check battery charge monthly

**Spring Startup Checklist** (April):
1. Inspect all tools for winter damage
2. Charge batteries fully
3. Test run each tool
4. Sharpen blades if needed
5. Check tire pressure (mower)
6. Verify safety features work

- ⚠️ Never store in direct sunlight or hot car
- ⚠️ Never use damaged battery (swelling, cracks, leaks)
- ⚠️ Never dispose in regular trash - recycle only

**Utah-Specific Concerns**:
- **Winter**: Never leave batteries in garage if temp drops below freezing
- **Summer**: Avoid charging during hottest part of day (89°F+)
- **Dry Climate**: Less corrosion risk, but more dust - keep connections clean

**Maximizing Battery Life**:
1. Avoid complete discharge - recharge at 20-30%
2. Don't leave on charger for days after full charge
3. Store at room temperature (50-70°F ideal)
4. Use tool until battery shows low indicator, then swap
5. Rotate between batteries to equalize wear
6. Clean battery contacts monthly with dry cloth

**Cold Weather Performance**:
- Batteries lose 20-30% capacity below 40°F
- Warm batteries indoors before use in cold weather
- Performance returns to normal as battery warms during use
