## Maintenance Procedures

### Chain Tension Adjustment
**Frequency**: Before each use, intermittently during operation, after warming up from cold start
**Best Time**: When saw is cool (never adjust hot chain)
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- **Cold weather**: Chain contracts when cold - may need re-tensioning after warming up
- **Hot weather**: Chain expands - don't over-tighten when cool
- **CRITICAL**: Never tension a hot chain - let cool completely first

**Proper Tension Test**:
- Pull chain away from bar - should fit a dime between teeth and bar
- Chain should move freely by hand around the bar
- No sagging on underside of bar
- Not so tight that it can't be pulled around bar

**Steps**:
1. **SAFETY FIRST**: Remove battery completely from unit
2. Loosen bar retaining nuts (typically 2 nuts on side cover)
3. Locate chain tensioning screw (usually at front or side of bar mount)
4. Turn tensioning screw CLOCKWISE to tighten, COUNTER-CLOCKWISE to loosen
5. Perform dime test: Pull chain from bar - dime should just fit between teeth and bar
6. Ensure chain moves freely around bar by hand
7. Hold bar tip up while tightening retaining nuts
8. Tighten retaining nuts securely in cross pattern
9. Final check: Pull chain around bar to verify proper tension
10. Reinstall battery and test chain brake before cutting

**Required Tools**:
- Combination wrench or socket (size varies by model - check manual)
- Flat screwdriver (for tensioning screw)
- Dime (for tension gauge)

**Warning Signs of Improper Tension**:
- Chain sags below bar = TOO LOOSE (derailment hazard)
- Cannot pull chain around bar = TOO TIGHT (will damage bar and chain)
- Chain smoking or burning = TOO TIGHT or insufficient oil
- Chain throws off during cutting = TOO LOOSE

---

### Bar and Chain Oil Management
**Frequency**: Check before each use, refill as needed during operation
**Best Time**: Before starting work, during cutting breaks
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- **Hot/dry weather**: Increased oil consumption - check more frequently
- **Cold weather**: May require winter-grade bar oil below 32°F
- **Dusty conditions**: Increased oil consumption to combat dust adhesion
- **First use**: Fill reservoir to half-full, then gauge consumption

**Steps**:
1. Place chainsaw on flat surface
2. Locate oil reservoir cap (typically on side of housing)
3. Check oil level through inspection window (if equipped)
4. Unscrew cap and inspect oil level
5. Fill with high-quality bar and chain oil
6. Do not overfill - leave small air gap
7. Wipe any spilled oil immediately
8. Test oil flow: Run saw briefly over cardboard - should see oil spray pattern
9. During use: Check for oil spray visible on wood surface while cutting

**Oil Level Indicators**:
- Fill to "MAX" line or leave 1/4" air gap
- During first few uses, check every 10-15 minutes to gauge consumption
- Typical tank lasts 30-60 minutes depending on cutting intensity

**Required Materials**:
- High-quality bar and chain oil (see Materials section)
- Clean rag for spills

**DO NOT USE**:
- ❌ Waste oil (damages pump)
- ❌ Thin oils like motor oil (insufficient lubrication)
- ❌ Cooking oils (unless specifically designed for bar/chain use)

**Storage Oil Leak Prevention**:
- Store with minimal oil in reservoir (prevents seepage)
- Store horizontally on drip tray or rag
- Oil will slowly seep from chain - this is normal

---

### Chain Sharpening
**Frequency**: Every 2-3 hours of cutting or when performance degrades
**Best Time**: End of day, when chain is cool
**Duration**: 15-25 minutes
**Difficulty**: Moderate (with practice)

**Signs Chain Needs Sharpening**:
- ✓ Produces fine sawdust instead of wood chips
- ✓ Requires excessive downward pressure to cut
- ✓ Cuts to one side instead of straight
- ✓ Chain bounces or chatters during cutting
- ✓ Excessive vibration
- ✓ Smoke even with proper tension and oil
- ✓ Slow cutting speed despite new sharpening

**Climate/Material Considerations**:
- Dirty wood dulls chains faster (logs on ground)
- Frozen wood is harder on chains
- Hardwood dulls faster than softwood
- Hitting dirt, rocks, or nails requires immediate sharpening

**Steps**:
1. Remove battery
2. Secure chainsaw in stable position (vise or workbench)
3. Mark starting point on chain with marker or file
4. Identify cutter angle (typically 30° for 3/8" pitch)
5. Use 3/16" (4.8mm) round file for 3/8" pitch chain
6. File guide helps maintain correct angle
7. File from inside of cutter outward at proper angle
8. Use equal number of strokes per cutter (3-5 strokes typically)
9. File all cutters in one direction, then rotate saw for opposite direction
10. Check depth gauge height with depth gauge tool
11. File depth gauges if they're too high (should be 0.025" below cutter)
12. Remove burrs from outside of cutter with flat file
13. Blow off filings and apply bar oil

**Required Tools**:
- 3/16" (4.8mm) round file for 3/8" pitch chain
- File guide with 30° angle setting
- Depth gauge tool
- Flat file for depth gauges
- Protective gloves
- Safety glasses
- Chain sharpening kit (contains all above)

**Sharpening Tips**:
- File all cutters to same length
- Maintain factory angle (typically 30°)
- File in one direction only (outward stroke)
- Apply moderate, consistent pressure
- Replace chain when cutters reach minimum length (~5mm)

**Professional Service Recommendation**:
- Have chain professionally sharpened every 5-10 home sharpenings
- Professional grinding restores factory precision
- Cost: $5-10 per chain at saw shops
