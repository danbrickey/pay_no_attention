## Maintenance Procedures

### Lawn Mowing (Utah Climate)
**Frequency**: Weekly during growing season (April-October)
**Best Time**: Morning after dew dries
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes for 5,000-6,000 SF
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- **Utah heat stress**: Keep grass at 2.5-3" height (higher in summer)
- Semi-arid climate requires taller grass to retain moisture
- South-facing yard gets intense afternoon sun - taller grass protects roots
- Mulch clippings to return nitrogen (unless excessive)

**Steps**:
1. Check mower blade sharpness (sharpen 2-3x per season)
2. Set mower height to 2.5-3 inches
3. Mow when grass is dry (prevents clumping)
4. Follow 1/3 rule: never remove more than 1/3 of blade height
5. Alternate mowing patterns weekly
6. Mulch clippings unless overly long
7. Edge sidewalks and beds

**Required Tools**: Lawn mower (your 80V GreenWorks), string trimmer, edger
**Materials Needed**: None (mulch clippings)

### Lawn Watering (Orem, Utah)
**Frequency**: 3x per week (adjust for rainfall)
**Best Time**: 4-8 AM to minimize evaporation
**Duration**: 20-30 minutes per zone
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- **Critical**: Only 18.7" annual rain - irrigation is essential
- Utah's 30% summer humidity = high evaporation
- Water restrictions may apply May-September (check Orem City)
- South-facing yard needs more water than north-facing areas

**Watering Schedule** (adjust by month):
- **May**: 2x per week, 15-20 min/zone
- **June-August**: 3x per week, 20-30 min/zone (peak need)
- **September**: 2x per week, 15-20 min/zone
- **October**: 1x per week, reduce gradually
- **November-April**: System winterized, no watering

**Steps**:
1. Water deeply and infrequently (promotes deep roots)
2. Total 1-1.5 inches per week (use tuna can test)
3. Adjust for rainfall (rare in Utah summers)
4. Water early morning (4-8 AM) to prevent disease
5. Check for dry spots (south-facing areas need more)
6. Monitor city watering restrictions

**Tuna Can Test**: Place empty tuna cans around lawn, run sprinklers, measure depth. Aim for 0.5" per watering session.

### Lawn Fertilization (Utah Climate)
**Frequency**: 4 times per year
**Best Timing**: Late April, Late May, Early August, Late October
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah soils are typically alkaline (pH 7.5-8.5)
- Cool-season grasses (Kentucky Bluegrass) thrive here
- Split applications prevent burn in hot, dry climate
- Fall fertilization is critical for Utah lawns

**Application Schedule**:
1. **Late April** (Spring green-up): Starter fertilizer, high nitrogen
2. **Late May** (Early growth): Balanced fertilizer (slow-release)
3. **Early August** (Summer stress recovery): Light application, slow-release
4. **Late October** (Winterizer): High potassium for cold hardiness

**Steps**:
1. Calculate lawn square footage (5,000-6,000 SF)
2. Choose slow-release fertilizer appropriate for season
3. Calibrate spreader for product recommendations
4. Apply when grass is dry
5. Water in thoroughly within 24 hours
6. Use drop spreader for precision on smaller lawn

**Required Tools**: Broadcast or drop spreader
**Materials Needed**:
- Spring: 29-0-4 or similar (1 lb N per 1,000 SF)
- Summer: 20-10-10 slow-release (0.5-1 lb N per 1,000 SF)
- Fall: 20-0-10 winterizer (1-1.5 lb N per 1,000 SF)

**Utah-Specific Recommendation**: Milorganite (6-4-0) is excellent for alkaline soils, organic, slow-release

### Lawn Aeration
**Frequency**: Annual
**Best Time**: Early September (best for Utah cool-season grasses)
**Duration**: 1-2 hours (5,000-6,000 SF)
**Difficulty**: Moderate (or hire professional)

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah's clay soils compact easily - aeration is essential
- September timing allows grass to recover before winter
- Cooler temperatures and increased humidity help recovery

**Steps**:
1. Water lawn deeply 1-2 days before (softens soil)
2. Rent core aerator or hire professional
3. Make 2-3 passes over lawn in different directions
4. Leave cores on lawn to decompose (adds nutrients)
5. Overseed within 48 hours while holes are open
6. Apply fall fertilizer after aerating
7. Water deeply to encourage new growth

**Required Tools**: Core aerator (rent from Home Depot Orem: $70-90/day)
**Professional Service**: $100-175 for 5,000 SF in Utah County

### Flower Bed Maintenance
**Frequency**: Weekly during growing season
**Best Time**: Morning or evening
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah's intense sun requires heat-tolerant perennials
- Mulch essential to retain moisture in semi-arid climate
- South-facing beds get extreme afternoon heat

**Tasks**:
- **Spring (May)**: Apply 2-3" mulch after last freeze, plant annuals after May 10
- **Summer (Jun-Sep)**: Deadhead weekly, water 2-3x weekly, weed as needed
- **Fall (Oct)**: Cut back perennials, add fall mums/ornamental kale, mulch
- **Winter (Nov-Mar)**: Minimal - plan spring additions

**Steps**:
1. Weed beds weekly (easier when small)
2. Deadhead spent blooms to encourage flowering
3. Water beds 2-3x weekly (drip irrigation ideal)
4. Refresh mulch annually (2-3" depth)
5. Fertilize annuals monthly with balanced fertilizer
6. Monitor for pests (aphids, spider mites in dry climate)

**Required Tools**: Hand trowel, pruning shears, hose/watering wand
**Materials Needed**: Mulch (cedar or shredded bark), annual flowers, fertilizer
