## Maintenance Procedures

### Oil Change (2013 Highlander)
**Frequency**: Every 5,000 miles or 6 months
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes (DIY) or 30 min at shop
**Difficulty**: Moderate (DIY) or Easy (shop)

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah temperature extremes require proper viscosity
- Use 0W-20 (best for cold starts) or 5W-30
- Synthetic oil recommended for temperature extremes

**Oil Specifications**:
- **Capacity**: 6.4 quarts (V6 3.5L) or 4.6 quarts (4-cyl 2.7L)
- **Viscosity**: 0W-20 (preferred) or 5W-30
- **Type**: Synthetic or synthetic blend
- **Filter**: Toyota OEM 04152-YZZA6 or equivalent

**DIY Steps**:
1. Warm engine slightly (helps oil drain)
2. Jack up vehicle safely, use jack stands
3. Locate drain plug (17mm socket)
4. Place drain pan, remove plug
5. Let drain completely (~10 min)
6. Replace drain plug washer, torque to 30 ft-lbs
7. Remove old filter (near front of engine)
8. Lubricate new filter gasket with clean oil
9. Hand-tighten new filter (3/4 turn after gasket contact)
10. Lower vehicle, add new oil (check dipstick)
11. Run engine 1 min, check for leaks, recheck level
12. Reset maintenance light (see owner's manual)

**Required Tools**: Jack, jack stands, 17mm socket, filter wrench, drain pan
**Materials**: 7 quarts 0W-20 oil, oil filter, drain plug washer (optional)

**Professional Service**: $40-70 at Jiffy Lube, Grease Monkey, or Toyota dealer

### Tire Rotation & Inspection
**Frequency**: Every 5,000-7,500 miles
**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Difficulty**: Moderate

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah roads with freeze-thaw cycles cause uneven wear
- Check for dry rot from UV exposure (common in Utah)
- Monitor tread depth for winter traction needs

**Rotation Pattern** (AWD Highlander):
- Front Left → Rear Right
- Front Right → Rear Left
- Rear Right → Front Left
- Rear Left → Front Right
(or use "X" pattern for all tires)

**Steps**:
1. Check tire pressure when cold (35 PSI typical, check door jamb)
2. Loosen lug nuts before jacking
3. Jack up vehicle, use jack stands
4. Remove tires, note position
5. Inspect for wear, damage, embedded objects
6. Rotate per pattern
7. Torque lug nuts to 80 ft-lbs in star pattern
8. Lower vehicle, final torque check
9. Reset TPMS if needed

**Inspection Points**:
- Tread depth (2/32" minimum, 6/32" for winter)
- Uneven wear (indicates alignment issues)
- Cracks, bulges, or dry rot
- Valve stem condition

**Required Tools**: Jack, jack stands, lug wrench, torque wrench, tire pressure gauge

### Battery Maintenance (Utah Climate)
**Frequency**: Test every 6 months (before summer and winter)
**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah's temperature extremes (19°F to 89°F) stress batteries
- Battery life typically 3-5 years in Utah (vs. 5-7 in moderate climates)
- Heat is biggest enemy - summer heat weakens battery

**Testing**:
1. Visual inspection - check for corrosion, cracks, bulging
2. Clean terminals if corroded (baking soda + water solution)
3. Test voltage with multimeter (12.4-12.7V = good, <12.2V = weak)
4. Load test at auto parts store (free at AutoZone, O'Reilly)
5. Check alternator charging (13.8-14.4V when running)

**Replacement Signs**:
- Slow cranking, especially in cold weather
- Dim headlights at idle
- Age 3+ years in Utah climate
- Voltage below 12.2V

**Battery Specifications (2013 Highlander)**:
- Group Size: 35 or 24F (check current battery)
- CCA Rating: 640+ (Utah winters need higher CCA)
- Recommended: Interstate, DieHard, Optima

**Required Tools**: Wrench set, battery terminal cleaner, voltmeter
**Materials**: Battery terminal cleaner, anti-corrosion spray, new battery when needed

**Professional Service**: Free testing at AutoZone, O'Reilly; replacement $120-250 installed

### Winter Preparation (October)
**Frequency**: Annual
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Difficulty**: Moderate

**Critical for Orem Winters**:
1. **Winter Tires**: Install by November 1
   - Blizzak, Michelin X-Ice, or Bridgestone Blizzak
   - Consider dedicated winter wheels for easy swap
2. **Antifreeze Check**: Should protect to -34°F minimum
   - Test with hydrometer ($10 at auto parts)
   - Flush/fill if weak (every 100k miles or 10 years)
3. **Battery Load Test**: Critical before cold weather
4. **Emergency Kit**: Blanket, flashlight, first aid, jumper cables, ice scraper
5. **Wiper Blades**: Replace with winter blades
6. **Washer Fluid**: Use winter formula (rated to -20°F or lower)

**Winter Tires** (for 2013 Highlander):
- Size: Check door jamb (likely 235/55R19 or 245/60R18)
- Mount on separate wheels: Save $50-100/year on swap labor
- Storage: Garage or basement (UV protected)
