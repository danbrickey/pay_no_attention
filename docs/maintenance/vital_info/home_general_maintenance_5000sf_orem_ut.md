## Maintenance Procedures

### HVAC Filter Replacement
**Frequency**: Monthly
**Best Time**: 1st of each month
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah's semi-arid climate means dust accumulation is significant
- High pollen in spring (April-May) may require bi-weekly changes
- Winter months have less dust but more indoor air circulation

**Steps**:
1. Turn off HVAC system
2. Locate filter (typically near furnace or return air vent)
3. Remove old filter, note size (likely 16x25x1 or 20x25x1 for 5,000 SF home)
4. Check for dust buildup and condition
5. Install new filter with airflow arrow pointing toward furnace
6. Record change date
7. Restart system

**Required Tools**: None
**Materials Needed**: MERV 8-11 filters (size specific to your system)

### Irrigation System Startup (Spring)
**Frequency**: Annual
**Best Time**: Late April (after last freeze, typically April 20-30)
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Difficulty**: Moderate

**Climate Considerations**:
- Orem's last freeze typically occurs mid-April
- Monitor 10-day forecast for temperatures below 32°F
- Utah's dry climate makes irrigation critical for lawn health

**Steps**:
1. Check local weather for freeze forecast
2. Slowly open main water valve to irrigation system
3. Run each zone manually for 5 minutes
4. Inspect all sprinkler heads for damage/leaks
5. Adjust heads for proper coverage
6. Check controller batteries and programming
7. Set watering schedule (see lawn maintenance section)

**Required Tools**: Screwdriver, sprinkler adjustment tool
**Materials Needed**: Replacement sprinkler heads (keep 3-5 on hand)

### Irrigation System Winterization
**Frequency**: Annual
**Best Time**: Mid-October (before first hard freeze)
**Duration**: 1-2 hours (DIY) or hire professional
**Difficulty**: Moderate-Professional

**Climate Considerations**:
- Orem's first hard freeze typically occurs mid to late October
- Failure to winterize can cause $1,000+ in pipe damage
- Must blow out ALL water to prevent freeze damage

**Steps** (Air Compressor Method):
1. Turn off water supply to irrigation system
2. Set controller to "rain" or "off" mode
3. Connect air compressor (minimum 10 CFM at 50 PSI)
4. Run each zone until only misting air comes out
5. Close valves and disconnect compressor
6. Drain backflow preventer
7. Insulate above-ground components

**Required Tools**: Air compressor (80+ gallon tank) or hire professional
**Materials Needed**: Insulation for backflow preventer

**Professional Service**: Recommended for first time, typically $60-100 in Utah County

### Gutter Cleaning
**Frequency**: Twice yearly
**Best Time**: April (spring debris), October (fall leaves)
**Duration**: 3-4 hours for 5,000 SF home
**Difficulty**: Moderate (height safety concern)

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah's low rainfall means less frequent cleaning than humid climates
- Spring cleaning removes winter debris before irrigation season
- Fall cleaning prevents ice dam formation in winter

**Steps**:
1. Set up sturdy ladder on level ground
2. Wear gloves and safety glasses
3. Remove debris by hand or with scoop
4. Flush gutters with hose, check downspouts
5. Inspect for damage, loose hangers, or leaks
6. Check that water flows away from foundation
7. Consider gutter guards to reduce maintenance

**Required Tools**: Extension ladder, gutter scoop, garden hose
**Materials Needed**: Gutter sealant (for repairs)

**Safety Warning**: Use ladder stabilizer, never overreach, consider professional service for safety
