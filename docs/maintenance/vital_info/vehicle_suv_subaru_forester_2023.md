### CVT Transmission Fluid (Critical)
**Frequency**: Every 60,000 miles (severe) or 100,000 miles (normal)
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Difficulty**: Professional recommended

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah's temperature swings and AWD use = "severe" service
- CVT fluid critical to transmission longevity
- Must use Subaru CVT fluid only (Subaru High Torque CVT Fluid)

**Severe Service Conditions** (all apply to Utah):
- Trailer towing
- Frequent hills/mountains (Wasatch Front)
- Dusty roads (semi-arid climate)
- Temperature extremes (-5°F to 89°F)

**Recommendation**: Service at 60,000 miles given Utah conditions

**Specifications**:
- **Fluid Type**: Subaru High Torque CVT Fluid (Lineartronic II) ONLY
- **Capacity**: ~11 quarts (drain and fill method)
- **Part Number**: SOA427V9100 (quarts) or SOA427V9000 (5-gallon)

**Professional Service Required**: $200-350 at dealer
- Requires specific fill procedure with warmed transmission
- Overfilling or underfilling damages CVT
- Must use Subaru CVT fluid - aftermarket not recommended

### Differential Fluid (AWD - Important)
**Frequency**: Every 30,000 miles (severe) or 60,000 miles (normal)
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Difficulty**: Moderate (DIY possible)

**Climate Considerations**:
- AWD system works harder in snow/ice (frequent in Utah)
- Utah qualifies as "severe" service due to terrain and weather

**Specifications**:
- **Front Differential**: Part of CVT system (serviced with CVT)
- **Rear Differential**: Separate service required
- **Fluid Type**: 75W-90 GL-5 gear oil
- **Capacity**: ~1.1 quarts

5. Remove drain plug (23mm, bottom)
6. Let drain completely
7. Reinstall drain plug with new washer, torque to 36 ft-lbs
8. Fill until fluid runs out of fill hole (~1.1 qt)
9. Reinstall fill plug with new washer, torque to 36 ft-lbs

**Professional Service**: $80-150 at Subaru dealer

**Recommendation**: Service at 30,000 miles given Utah AWD usage

### Battery Maintenance (Utah Climate)
**Frequency**: Test every 6 months
**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- 2023 Forester has Start/Stop system - battery is AGM type
- Utah heat/cold cycles reduce battery life to 3-5 years
- Replacement must be AGM battery (standard battery damages system)

**Testing**:
1. Visual inspection for corrosion or damage
2. Clean terminals if needed (baking soda solution)
3. Test voltage: 12.4-12.7V = good, <12.2V = weak
4. Load test at auto parts store (free)
5. Check alternator output: 13.8-14.4V when running

**Battery Specifications (2023 Forester)**:
- Type: AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) - REQUIRED for Start/Stop
- Group Size: 25 or H5 (check current battery)
- CCA Rating: 600+ for Utah winters
- Recommended: Interstate, Optima Yellow Top (AGM only)

**IMPORTANT**: Must use AGM battery - conventional damages Start/Stop system
**Cost**: $200-350 (AGM batteries more expensive)

**Professional Service**: Subaru dealer or specialty shop familiar with AGM

### EyeSight System Maintenance
**Frequency**: Clean cameras weekly in winter, monthly in summer
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Utah winter road spray coats windshield/cameras
- EyeSight disabled if cameras obscured
- Critical safety feature - keep clean

**Steps**:
1. Use microfiber cloth and glass cleaner
2. Clean inside windshield where cameras are (top center)
3. Clean outside windshield thoroughly
4. Check for EyeSight warning lights
5. In winter, remove ice/snow from windshield completely

**Location**: Stereo cameras mounted at top of windshield (driver side of mirror)

**Professional Calibration** (after windshield replacement):
- Must be done at Subaru dealer
- Cost: $150-300
- Critical for safety system function

### Winter Preparation (October)
**Frequency**: Annual
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Difficulty**: Moderate

**Forester AWD + Utah Winter**:
1. **Winter Tires** (optional with AWD, but recommended):
   - 225/60R17 (base) or 225/55R18 (Sport/Limited)
   - Blizzak, X-Ice, or Continental VikingContact
2. **Antifreeze Check**: Subaru Long Life Coolant to -34°F
3. **Battery Test**: AGM battery critical for Start/Stop in cold
4. **Wiper Blades**: Replace with winter blades or heated wipers
5. **Washer Fluid**: Winter formula (-20°F or colder)
6. **Emergency Kit**: Blanket, flashlight, jumper cables, ice scraper

**AWD Note**: Forester's AWD excellent in snow, but winter tires still improve stopping/turning by 30-40%
