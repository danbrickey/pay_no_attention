## Maintenance Calendar

| Task | Frequency | Optimal Timing | Climate Notes | Critical? |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Check chain tension | Before each use | Year-round | Cold weather can cause chain contraction | Yes |
| Check oil level | Before each use | Year-round | Increase frequency in hot/dusty conditions | Yes |
| Clean bar groove | After each use | Year-round | More frequent in dirty/dusty conditions | Yes |
| Inspect chain sharpness | Every 2-3 uses | Year-round | Dull chain increases kickback risk | Yes |
| Clean air vents | Weekly during use | Year-round | More frequent in dusty conditions | No |
| Deep clean and inspect | Monthly during season | Before storage | Essential before winter storage | No |
| Sharpen or replace chain | As needed | Year-round | More frequent with hardwood cutting | Yes |
| Battery maintenance | Monthly | Year-round | Store at 30-50% charge in cool place | Yes |

**Seasonal Breakdown:**

- **Spring**: Deep clean after storage, inspect all components, fresh bar oil, check battery condition
- **Summer**: Monitor for overheating, increase cleaning frequency in dry/dusty conditions, check oil consumption
- **Fall**: Peak usage season - weekly inspections, keep spare chain on hand, prepare for storage
- **Winter**: Store properly (see storage section), minimal outdoor use below 32°F, battery storage critical

## Maintenance Procedures

### Chain Tension Adjustment
**Frequency**: Before each use and as needed during operation
**Best Time**: Before starting work, when saw is completely cool
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Cold weather causes chain to contract - may need adjustment after warming up
- Heat causes expansion - don't over-tighten when cold

**Steps**:
1. **SAFETY FIRST**: Remove battery completely from unit
2. Loosen the bar retaining knob (turn counter-clockwise)
3. Locate chain tensioning screw on side of polesaw head
4. Turn tensioning screw CLOCKWISE to tighten, COUNTER-CLOCKWISE to loosen
5. Proper tension test: Pull chain around bar by hand - should move freely but have no sag on underside
6. Chain should be snug against guide bar but not overly tight
7. Tighten bar retaining knob securely (turn clockwise)
8. Final check: Pull chain to verify proper tension before installing battery

**Required Tools**:
- None (tool-less adjustment system)

**Warning Signs of Improper Tension**:
- Chain sags below bar = TOO LOOSE (safety hazard - can derail)
- Chain cannot be pulled around bar = TOO TIGHT (will damage bar and chain)
- Chain smoking during use = TOO TIGHT

---

### Bar and Chain Oil Management
**Frequency**: Check before each use, refill every 30 minutes of operation
**Best Time**: Before starting, during breaks
**Duration**: 1-2 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Hot weather increases oil consumption
- Cold weather may require winter-grade bar oil
- Dusty conditions require more frequent checks

**Steps**:
1. Place polesaw on flat surface, motor head upward
2. Locate oil reservoir cap (typically on motor housing)
3. Check oil level through inspection window if available
4. Unscrew oil cap and fill with high-quality bar and chain oil
5. Do not overfill - leave small air gap at top
6. Wipe any spilled oil immediately
7. After first few minutes of use, check oil flow by holding bar over cardboard - should see oil spray pattern

**Required Materials**:
- High-quality bar and chain oil (see Materials section)

**DO NOT USE**:
- ❌ Waste oil
- ❌ Thin oils (like motor oil)
- ❌ Vegetable oil (unless specifically designed for bar/chain)

**Storage Oil Leak Prevention**:
- Store with minimal oil in reservoir
- Store upright with motor head at top
- Place on rag or drip tray

---

### Chain Sharpening
**Frequency**: Every 2-3 hours of cutting or when performance degrades
**Best Time**: End of day, before storage
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Difficulty**: Moderate

**Signs Chain Needs Sharpening**:
- Produces sawdust instead of wood chips
- Requires excessive pressure to cut
- Cuts to one side
- Causes excessive vibration

**Steps**:
1. Remove battery
2. Secure polesaw in stable position
3. Use 5/32" (4.0mm) round file for 1/4" pitch chain
4. File each cutter at 30° angle, maintaining manufacturer's angle
5. Equal number of strokes per cutter (typically 3-5)
6. Check depth gauge height with depth gauge tool
7. File depth gauges if needed (should be 0.025" below cutter)

**Required Tools**:
- 5/32" (4.0mm) round file
- File guide for 30° angle
- Depth gauge tool
- Flat file for depth gauges

**Professional Service Recommendation**:
- Have chain professionally sharpened every 5-10 sharpenings
- Replace chain when cutters are reduced to minimum length (check manual diagram)

---

### Bar Groove Cleaning
**Frequency**: After each use
**Best Time**: Immediately after use while still slightly warm
**Duration**: 5 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- More critical in dusty, dirty conditions
- Essential after cutting green wood or in damp conditions

**Steps**:
1. Remove battery
2. Remove chain and bar (reverse of installation procedure)
3. Use bar groove cleaner or stiff wire to clean debris from groove
4. Clean oil holes on bar
5. Flip bar over for even wear (every cleaning)
6. Inspect bar for burrs or damage
7. Check bar rails are parallel and true
8. Clean sprocket area on saw head
9. Reassemble with cleaned/sharpened chain

**Required Tools**:
- Bar groove cleaning tool
- Wire brush
- Clean rag
- Protective gloves

### Battery Care and Maintenance
**Frequency**: After each use, monthly checks
**Best Time**: Immediately after use for cooling, monthly for storage
**Duration**: 5 minutes active care
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Climate Considerations**:
- Do not charge or use below 32°F (0°C)
- Do not store above 110°F (43°C)
- Ideal storage temperature: 50-77°F (10-25°C)

**Steps**:
1. After use, allow battery to cool before charging
2. Charge in well-ventilated area on non-flammable surface
3. For storage, maintain 30-50% charge level
4. Check battery every 30 days in storage
5. Recharge if needed to maintain 30-50% level
6. Inspect terminals for corrosion or damage
7. Clean terminals with dry cloth if needed

**Battery Life Extension Tips**:
- Avoid complete discharge
- Don't leave on charger after full charge
- Store in cool, dry place
- Use regularly (monthly minimum)

---

### Pre-Season Inspection (Spring)
**Frequency**: Annual
**Best Time**: Early spring before first use
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Difficulty**: Moderate

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Inspect entire shaft for cracks or damage
- [ ] Check all connections and locking mechanisms
- [ ] Verify shaft extends and locks properly
- [ ] Inspect power head housing for damage
- [ ] Check all bolts and fasteners for tightness

### Winter Storage Procedure
**Frequency**: Annual (if seasonal use)
**Best Time**: Late fall after last use
**Duration**: 45 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Steps**:
1. Clean polesaw completely (all sections)
2. Sharpen or replace chain
3. Apply light oil to chain and bar for rust prevention
4. Empty bar oil reservoir (or minimize to prevent leaking)
5. Remove battery
6. Charge battery to 40-50%
7. Store battery separately in climate-controlled space
8. Store polesaw upright (motor head up) or horizontal on protective surface
9. Cover with breathable cloth (not plastic)
10. Store in dry, temperature-controlled area
11. Keep away from corrosive materials

**Storage Location Requirements**:
