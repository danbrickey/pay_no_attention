## How to Use This Index

### For Humans
Browse by intent, document type, or category to find what you need. Each entry links to the actual documentation.

### For AI Assistants
1. **Start here** when users ask "Where's the info on X?" or "Do we have docs for Y?"
2. Use "Quick Navigation by Intent" to match user questions to documentation
3. Fall back to category/type browsing when intent is unclear
4. When creating new documentation, **register it here** in all relevant sections

## Maintenance Instructions

**When creating new documentation** (applies to all documentation-generating prompts):

1. **Add to Quick Navigation by Intent** (if applicable)
   - Add row with user's likely question â†’ path to docs
   - Make intent descriptions user-friendly

2. **Add to Index by Document Type**
   - Place in appropriate type section with description
   - Link to the file with brief purpose statement

3. **Add to Index by Category**
   - Organize by primary topic/domain
   - Group related docs together

4. **Update version and last_updated** in frontmatter above

5. **Consider updating taxonomy.md** if new classification terms needed
