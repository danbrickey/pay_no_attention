# Additional Context for AI Assistants

## About This File
This file can be used to provide domain-specific context to AI assistants. Customize it based on your work and reference materials.

## Example: Architecture Documentation Structure

If you maintain architecture documentation, you might organize it like:

```
docs/architecture/
├── project-overview.md          # Executive summary and context
├── platform-architecture.md     # Technical platform details
├── patterns/                    # Implementation patterns
│   ├── design-pattern-1.md
│   └── design-pattern-2.md
└── standards/
    └── documentation-standards.md
```

## Example: Domain Knowledge Base

For technical domains, you might maintain:

```
docs/knowledge-base/
├── domain-guide.md              # Domain-specific implementation guide
├── environment-setup.md         # Environment configuration
└── best-practices.md            # Standards and conventions
```
